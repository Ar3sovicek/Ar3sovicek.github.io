            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>BMW, established in 1916 in Germany, initially focused on producing aircraft engines during World War I. After the war, they transitioned to motorcycles and subsequently entered the automotive industry with their first car, the Dixi, in the 1920s. BMW's engineering excellence became evident with the introduction of the BMW 328 sports car in the 1930s, which achieved notable success in racing and showcased their commitment to innovation.</p>
            <p>Facing financial challenges post-World War II, BMW rebounded in the 1960s with the introduction of the BMW 1500, marking their entry into the luxury car market. The success of the "New Class" sedans followed, renowned for their sporty handling and precision engineering, solidifying BMW's reputation as a driver's car.</p>
            <p>Throughout the decades, BMW has expanded its vehicle lineup to encompass a wide range of models, from luxury sedans like the 7 Series to SUVs such as the X5, and high-performance vehicles like the M series. They've pioneered technologies such as efficient engines, advanced safety features, and cutting-edge infotainment systems, maintaining their status as a leader in automotive innovation.</p>
            <p>Today, BMW continues to uphold its legacy of quality, performance, and driving pleasure. With a global presence and a commitment to sustainability through initiatives like electric mobility (BMW i) and efficient production practices, BMW remains a symbol of automotive excellence, blending tradition with forward-thinking innovation.</p>
