                <h2>BMW 8 Series (E31)</h2>
                <h3>1989-1999</h3>
                <p>In 1989, BMW launched the first generation of the 8 Series, the E31, to replace the aging first-generation 6 Series, which had been on the market since 1976. Despite the 6 Series' reputation as an excellent Grand Tourer, it was showing its age.</p>
                <p>The 6 Series was well-regarded but lacked some features to be a top Grand Tourer, such as only having six-cylinder engines and using an outdated platform. BMW addressed these issues with the launch of the 8 Series in 1989, which introduced advanced technology like electronic adjustable damping and passive rear steering.</p>
                <p>The 8 Series featured a sleek design reminiscent of the M1, with a narrow front end, pop-up headlights, and a kidney grille. Its elegant profile and bio-design language made it stand out, with notable design elements like the sloped rear window and wide taillights. The rear included a short deck and four exhausts.</p>
                <p>Inside, the 8 Series was luxurious, with a rounded dashboard, an advanced onboard computer, and a high-end stereo system. The front seats had integrated seat belts, and although the back seats were tight, they offered dual-zone climate control, heated front seats, and power windows.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the 8 Series featured a 5.0-liter V12 engine from the 750i, enhanced for more power. It came with a six-speed manual or an optional four-speed automatic in the U.S. The car also included advanced safety features like ABS and ASC+T (Automatic Stability Control + Traction).</p>

            <h2>Second generation</h2>

Known as the G15, it offers powerful engines from turbocharged six-cylinders to V8s. The interior includes advanced technology, a digital instrument cluster, and luxurious materials. With adaptive suspension and all-wheel drive, the G15 delivers a blend of performance and luxury.</p>

                <h2>BMW 8 Series Convertible (G14)</h2>
                <h3>2018-2022</h3>
                <p>The first convertible 8 Series debuted as part of a three-model lineup, placing it at the top of BMW's range. The 8 Series name was revived in 2018 to replace the 6 Series.</p>
                <p>The 8 Series Convertible featured a classic soft-top roof that opened or closed in 15 seconds at speeds up to 50 kph (31 mph) and was available in black or silver. Initially, it came with two engine options paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and xDrive all-wheel drive.</p>
                <p>The 840d xDrive had a 3.0-liter diesel engine with 320 hp and 680 Nm of torque, while the M850i xDrive featured a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 with 530 hp and 750 Nm of torque.</p>
                <p>The interior boasted high-quality materials, a 10.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system, voice control, and Apple CarPlay (but not Android Auto). Comfortable, adjustable seats were standard, though visibility was limited due to the low seating position and high window line. The car included front and rear parking sensors, a rear-view camera, and LED headlights.</p>

                <h2>BMW 8 Series Coupe (G15)</h2>
                <h3>2018-2022</h3>
                <p>In 2018, BMW launched the second-generation 8 Series Coupe, replacing the 6 Series Coupe in its lineup. Despite its higher price and new name, it retains the size and features of its predecessor. Positioned against luxury grand tourers like the Bentley Continental GT and Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe, the new 8 Series Coupe emphasizes performance over pure luxury.</p>
                <p>Built alongside the BMW 7 Series at BMW's Dingolfing plant, the luxury 8 Series coupe is part of a trio that includes convertible and four-door coupe variants. Depending on the engine chosen, it offers either intelligent xDrive AWD or rear-wheel-drive on entry-level models. Engine choices include turbocharged inline-six gasoline and diesel options, while top models feature twin-turbocharged gasoline V8 powerplants exclusively.</p>
                <p>Unlike some luxury coupes without a B-pillar, the 8 Series Coupe retains one, with fixed rear side windows. Although headroom can be limited, especially for rear passengers, an optional carbon-fiber-reinforced-plastic (CFRP) roof is available, a first for BMW production models, which helps lower the car's center of gravity.</p>

                <h2>BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe (G16)</h2>
                <h3>2019-Present</h3>
                <p>After replacing the 6 Series coupe with the 8 Series, BMW continued its push into the premium sports sedan market by introducing the Gran Coupe version of the 8 Series in June 2019, with sales beginning in September of the same year.</p>
                <p>Based on the same CLAR architecture as the 7 Series (G11) and 5 Series (G30), launched in 2015 and 2016 respectively, BMW introduced the Gran Coupe version of the 8 Series in June 2019, with sales beginning in September of the same year. Competing with models like the Mercedes-Benz CLS, AMG GT 4-Door Coupe, and Porsche Panamera, it aimed to blend luxury with sporty appeal.</p>
                <p>Sharing its front fascia with the two-door variant, the Gran Coupe featured swept-back LED headlights with hexagonal-shaped daytime running lights, optional Laser headlamps, and a distinct bumper with large air intakes. Profile-wise, it had extracting vents behind the front wheel wells, more upright A-pillars, and an arched roof sloping towards the rear seats. The rear boasted wide taillights extending across the trunk lid.</p>
                <p>Inside, it offered a four-seat layout with two individual front seats and a bench in the rear, optimized for two adults. The taller greenhouse provided better headroom for front occupants, who accessed the iDrive infotainment system via a touchscreen or rotary dial controller. Rear passengers had adequate headroom but were separated by a tall transmission tunnel and armrest.</p>
                <p>Powering the Gran Coupe were the same turbocharged inline-six and V8 engines as the coupe, available in gasoline or diesel variants, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission driving all wheels.</p>

                <h2>BMW 8 Series Coupe</h2>
                <h3>2022-Present</h3>
                <p>In 2022, BMW updated the 8 Series lineup, four years after its initial launch in 2018. This refresh brought a mild facelift to the car, which revived a '90s nameplate in BMW's lineup.</p>
                <p>In 2022, BMW continued its lineage from the 6 Series to the 8 Series, paying homage to its iconic GT heritage. The 2022 models, available as coupe, convertible, and four-door Gran Coupe, maintained the sleek silhouette with a sloped roofline and optional carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) roof. All models now came standard with an M-package, featuring a distinctive V-shaped center grille and wide air scoops for enhanced cooling.</p>
                <p>Inside, the dashboard layout remained classic with digital displays for both instrument cluster and infotainment, housed in a driver-focused center stack. The center console created a cockpit-like feel for the driver.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW surprised by continuing to offer a turbodiesel version, now enhanced with a hybrid system for lower CO2 emissions. Power was delivered to the rear wheels or all four wheels, depending on the model.</p>

                <h2>BMW 8 Series Convertible</h2>
                <h3>2022-Present</h3>
                <p>In 2022, BMW gave the entire 8-Series lineup a refresh, including the convertible version. This update brought more refinement, additional technology, and subtle design enhancements to the already beautiful open-top grand tourer.</p>
                <p>The first generation of the BMW 8-Series, the E31, debuted in 1990 and quickly became a hit despite its high price. It was initially only available as a coupe and later gained popularity after being discontinued. In 2018, BMW revived the prestigious nameplate, this time introducing a convertible variant and making all the right moves.</p>
                <p>The refreshed 8-Series featured an M aerodynamic package across the lineup. Its front bumper included a V-shaped grille surrounded by air scoops directing airflow to the front brakes. Extracting vents behind the wheel wells aided in reducing drag. The convertible model boasted a classic fabric roof that operated swiftly, folding up or down in just 15 seconds. Inside, space was somewhat limited, accommodating four passengers snugly.</p>
                <p>Surprisingly, BMW continued to offer a turbocharged diesel version with a hybrid system aimed at lowering CO2 emissions to meet 2022 standards. Power was delivered to the rear wheels or all four wheels, depending on the model.</p>
