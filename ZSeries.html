                <h3>1988-1991</h3>
                <p>The first BMW Z in history shared its main components with the successful BMW 3-Series E30. It was a pure roadster, showcasing the designers' huge imagination.</p>
                <p>In the mid-'80s, BMW aimed to create a revolutionary car and revive its pre-WWII roadster heritage. In 1988, they introduced the Z1, a unique model with no panels carried over from the 3-Series. Its standout features included flared fenders and vertically opening doors that slid down to open. The cabin had two bucket seats, a center console, and a unique instrument cluster. The Z1, more of a concept car made into production, featured an inline-six 2.5-liter engine with a 5-speed manual transmission.</p>

                <h2>BMW Z3 Roadster (E36)</h2>
                <h3>1996-2003</h3>
                <p>The Z3 was BMW's first vehicle built exclusively outside Germany and the first mass-produced model in the Z-series. It also marked BMW's debut in the James Bond movie franchise.</p>
                <p>The BMW Z3 succeeded the Z1 without a Z2 in between. Built on a platform blending the E36 and E30 models, it sported a classic roadster design with a lengthy hood, compact cabin, and short rear deck. Its rounded shape and wide headlights with clear lenses were popular among buyers until production ended in 2003. The front fenders featured exhaust vents reminiscent of the BMW 507 roadster.</p>
                <p>Inside, the Z3 offered a two-seat layout with a prominent center console. The dashboard, borrowed from the E36, featured sporty dials and gauges. The seats were sport-bucket style with high bolstering, ideal for spirited driving.</p>
                <p>Despite its mixed platform, the Z3 delivered quick and agile performance. Initially available with engine choices ranging from 1.8-liter to 2.8-liter, it underwent a refresh in 1999, upgrading engines to include a 2.2-liter and 3.0-liter options. The M versions offered a different level of performance altogether.</p>

                <h2>BMW Z3 Coupe (E36)</h2>
                <h3>1998-2002</h3>
                <p>When it debuted in 1995, the Z3 was a milestone as the first roadster produced in significant numbers in a long while. Its predecessor, the Z1, had been limited to just 8,000 units.</p>
                <p>Two and a half years after the Z3 roadster made waves, BMW took a bold step by introducing a shooting-brake variant based on the Z3 platform. Initially a passion project by BMW engineers outside of work hours, the concept impressed management enough to receive approval.</p>
                <p>The front of the car resembled the Z3 roadster, featuring distinctive slats on the front fenders reminiscent of the BMW 507. However, from the A-pillars rearward, it took on a new identity. A straight, fixed roof extended from the windshield to the rear, where it dropped dramatically behind the rear wheels with a sloping C-pillar. At the rear, a practical tailgate provided access to a spacious trunk area, given the car's dimensions.</p>
                <p>Inside, the focus was on practicality rather than squeezing in small rear seats for tax reasons. The front bucket seats were positioned lower, providing a sporty driving position. Based on the E36 platform, it shared components like the instrument cluster and center stack layout with the 3-Series.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the Z3 Coupe exclusively offered straight-six engines. Initially powered by a 2.8-liter engine from 1998 to 2000, it was later upgraded to a 3.0-liter engine until 2002. All engine variants were paired with a standard 5-speed manual transmission.</p>

                <h3>2000-2003</h3>
                <p>The BMW Z8 is a magnificent roadster that pays homage to the glorious BMW 507. It's considered one of the most beautiful homage cars ever made and stands as the largest homage production vehicle created by the German automaker.</p>
                <p>The BMW Z8 began as the Z07 concept unveiled at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show before being finalized as the Z8, a 2-seat luxury roadster. Inspired by the classic BMW 507, its design features a long hood, compact cabin, and short rear end. The front grille differs with large rather than tall BMW kidneys, echoing the 507. Historical cues include side vents on the front fenders.</p>
                <p>Powering the Z8 was BMW's top engine at the time, a 4.9-liter V8 from the E39 BMW M5, producing 400 hp and 500 Nm (369 lb-ft) of torque, paired with a 6-speed manual gearbox and LSD-equipped rear axle. It combined high performance with a luxurious interior featuring leather, aluminum, and wood trim. The Z8 stole the spotlight upon its launch and is hailed as one of the finest designs led by chief designer Chris Bangle.</p>

                <h3>2002-2006</h3>
                <p>The BMW Z4 debuted in 2002, succeeding the BMW Z3 from 1995. Initially offered only as a roadster, BMW later introduced a coupe version in 2006.</p>
                <p>The BMW Z4, launched as the E85 Roadster, boasted larger dimensions, a longer wheelbase, and wider body compared to its predecessor, the Z3. Its suspension was upgraded with a stiffer setup and a sport package that enhanced steering response. The multilink suspension, borrowed from the BMW 3 Series, offered advanced handling capabilities.</p>
                <p>The steering system transitioned from hydraulic to electric servo control, adjusting based on suspension movement and speed, although some critics felt it lost some precision as a result.</p>
                <p>The Roadster (E85) was available with a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, or 5-speed automatic transmission. The Coupe, introduced in 2006, offered a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic with steering column-mounted shift paddles.</p>
                <p>All Z4 variants were powered by gasoline engines, with options across seven different displacements and power outputs. The M versions, both Coupe and Roadster, featured the potent 3.2-liter engine from the M3, delivering 343 hp and paired with a 6-speed manual gearbox as standard.</p>

                <p>The 2006 BMW Z4 M-Coupe was a sporty three-door fastback designed to carry two passengers and their luggage at high speeds. It was derived from the Z4 Roadster model.</p>
                <p>The BMW Z4 M Coupe succeeded the Z3 M Coupe with a new approach. Unlike its predecessor, which was a passion project by BMW engineers, the Z4 Coupe was integrated into the Z4 project from the start. It featured a sleek design with a low hood, raked A-pillars, and a sloped-back roofline, emphasizing speed and aggression over practicality. The M version sported quad exhausts mounted on the outside of the rear bumper for a wider appearance.</p>
                <p>Inside, leather upholstery and sport-bucket seats were standard, along with a high center console that enhanced the driver-focused experience. The instrument cluster, inspired by M versions, featured a binocular-style design with an LCD display between the speedometer and tachometer tunnels.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the Z4 M Coupe housed the same 3.2-liter inline-six engine as the E46 M3, delivering powerful performance akin to its larger counterpart.</p>

                <p>BMW, renowned for its heritage in crafting open-top sports cars, rekindled excitement in the segment by launching the M-badged version of the Z4 Roadster in 2006.</p>
                <p>BMW has a rich legacy in crafting open-top sports cars, dating back to the 1938 BMW 328. Following WWII, their attempts to re-enter the segment faced challenges, notably with the 1956 507, which struggled financially. In the late ‘80s, the Z1 captured hearts, leading to BMW's strong comeback with the 1995 Z3, followed by the 2002 Z4. In 2005, BMW introduced the M version for the Z4 coupe, followed by the Roadster in 2006, marking significant upgrades.</p>
                <p>The Z4 M Roadster appeared similar at first glance, but featured notable distinctions. The front boasted redesigned bumpers with a trapezoidal air intake and reversed side scoops. M-specific badges adorned the sculpted doors, following Chris Bangle's flame-surfacing design. Exclusive five twin-spoke alloy wheels revealed upgraded brakes, while safety arches and a duck-tail spoiler enhanced the rear. The cockpit featured high-bolstered sports seats in suede or leather/Alcantara, with an optional carbon fiber trim package for the center console, stack, and dashboard. The binocular-style instrument cluster showcased large dials for speedometer and tachometer, with additional gauges in the rev counter for fuel level and oil temperature. Under the hood, a 3.2-liter inline-six engine delivered power via a six-speed manual transmission, supported by hydraulic power steering and an M-differential for enhanced performance.</p>

                <p>The Z4 offered luxury, balance, and performance in the premium roadster market, making it key to an engaging driving experience. In its 3rd generation, BMW combined the coupe and convertible into a single model, featuring an adaptive M suspension and electronically controlled dampers for improved comfort.</p>
                <p>The flagship Z4 sDrive35i had a 3.0-liter twin-turbo engine producing 306 hp, reaching 100 kph in 5.2 seconds, and slightly faster with the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission.</p>
                <p>Its design blended elements of the 6-Series Coupe and 3-Series, with classic roadster proportions. The retractable metal top could be raised or lowered in 20 seconds, a first for BMW with its two-piece electro-hydraulic hard-top.</p>
                <p>In 2009, visibility improved significantly. Despite being pricey, the Z4 was well-equipped, powerful, and fun to drive, competing with less expensive options like the Mazda MX-5 and Nissan 370Z.</p>

                <p>BMW has a long history of making roadsters for driving pleasure. In 2018, BMW launched the new Z4, available only as a roadster. Unlike the previous generation with a retractable hard-top, those wanting a coupe can opt for the similar 2018 Toyota Supra, which has a fixed top.</p>
                <p>Unlike the Supra, the Z4 offers three engine options: a 2.0-liter (naturally aspirated or turbocharged) and a 3.0-liter turbocharged, with power ranging from 197 to 340 hp. The base model, sDrive 2.0i, has a 6-speed manual gearbox, while the others come with an 8-speed Steptronic automatic.</p>
                <p>The new Z4 is bigger overall but has a shorter 2.47-meter (97.2") wheelbase, improving agility and maintaining a 50:50 weight distribution. Technological features include a digital instrument cluster, advanced infotainment, and smartphone-based keyless entry using NFC technology.</p>

                <h2>BMW Z4</h2>
                <h3>2024-Present</h3>
                <p>For 2025, BMW introduced a six-speed manual for the Z4 M40i, responding to customer demand. The car also received several other upgrades.</p>
                <p>When BMW launched the third-generation Z4 in 2018, customers loved it despite its shared platform with the Toyota Supra J29. Tuned for comfortable drives, the Z4 offered solid performance but wasn’t as hard-core as its Japanese counterpart. Initially, the Z4 was available with a six-speed manual only in select countries with a 2.0-liter engine. Higher-powered versions had an eight-speed automatic. In 2024, BMW introduced a six-speed manual option for the Z4 with a 3.0-liter turbocharged engine, named the Pure Impulse edition.</p>
                <p>The 2025 Z4 M40i featured a revised front fascia with a hexagonal-patterned kidney grille, additional air intakes, and angular side scoops.
