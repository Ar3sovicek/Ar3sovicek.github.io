                <h2>BMW 4 Series Coupe (F32)</h2>
                <h3>2013-2018</h3>
                <p>The 4 Series marked the end of the 3 Series Coupe and started a new series for BMW. The 4 Series Coupe was based on the same platform as the F30 BMW 3 Series.</p>
                <p>The 3 Series began as a coupe in the '70s and expanded to include sedans, station wagons, convertibles, and the 3 Series Compact. As coupe shapes evolved, BMW introduced the 4 Series.</p>
                <p>Launched at the 2013 Detroit Auto Show, the 4 Series shared its platform with the 3 Series but was otherwise distinct. It featured a sporty design with a low, wide stance, narrow grille, swept headlights, and a large front air intake.</p>
                <p>Inside, standard bucket seats, a driver-focused dashboard, and a floating i-Drive screen characterized the cabin. The rear had seating for two with a 40:20:40 split-folding backseat.</p>
                <p>The 4 Series came in four trim levels, each customizable, with a variety of gasoline and diesel engines, rear or all-wheel drive, and either a manual or 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>

                <h2>BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe (F36)</h2>
                <h3>2014-2018</h3>
                <p>After debuting the BMW 4 Series at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, BMW launched the Gran Coupe version in spring 2014 at the Geneva Motor Show.</p>
                <p>BMW had two lines in the same segment: the 3 Series GT and the 4 Series Gran Coupe, both 5-door hatchbacks. The 4 Series Gran Coupe was sleeker and sportier.</p>
                <p>The 4 Series Gran Coupe had the same length as the 2-door 4 Series but was 12 mm taller, providing more headroom for rear passengers. It featured frameless doors like a regular coupe and kept the same front design as the 2-door version. It aimed to offer a smaller, more affordable 4-door coupe similar to the 6-Series Gran Coupe.</p>
                <p>Inside, it was a 4+1 seater, though the middle rear seat was cramped due to the transmission tunnel. The rear bench split 40:20:40, expanding trunk space to 1300 liters. The liftgate had automatic opening and closing, with an optional hands-free feature. The interior had the same technology as the 4 Series, including an infotainment system on the center stack.</p>
                <p>The 4 Series Gran Coupe had the same engine options as the 2-door version, with diesel and gasoline engines from 143 hp to 313 hp, and most versions offered all-wheel drive.</p>

                <h2>BMW 4 Series Convertible (F33)</h2>
                <h3>2014-2018</h3>
                <p>BMW introduced the 4 Series as the coupe version of the 3 Series, available in two or four-door hatchback styles. In 2014, they also released the Convertible version.</p>
                <p>When BMW retired the two-door 3 Series, some fans were upset, but it was a strategic move to differentiate the models. The 4 Series Convertible, like the last 3 Series Convertible, featured a retractable hard top. It shared its front fascia with the 4 Series coupe, including a wide kidney grille, narrow headlights, and a broad lower scoop. The raked A-pillars provided roll-over protection, eliminating the need for a B-pillar.</p>
                <p>Inside, the standard bucket seats had high bolstering. The dashboard and center console were driver-focused, with an i-Drive system screen mounted on top. The rear bench was pushed forward to accommodate the retractable top, limiting legroom for back-seat passengers.</p>
                <p>The 4 Series came in four trim levels, each customizable, and offered a range of gasoline and diesel engines with rear or all-wheel drive.</p>

                <h3>2018-2020</h3>
                <p>The new BMW 4 Series embodied luxury, sportiness, and practicality.</p>
                <p>The 4 Series was sportier than the 3 Series it was based on, offering almost as much practicality as a sedan. It featured agile handling due to a lower center of gravity and a wider track. The 4 Series was one of the widest coupes available, with a spacious trunk and foldable rear seats for longer items.</p>
                <p>The cabin was crafted with high-quality materials and had a sporty design. Front seating was roomy, with ample legroom and headroom for rear passengers despite being a coupe. The 4 Series came in coupe, convertible, and 4-door Gran Coupe body styles.</p>
                <p>It offered a variety of engines: three gasoline options (184-326 hp) and three diesel options (190-313 hp). BMW's xDrive technology was standard on the coupe, providing excellent handling and grip. The 4 Series also featured selectable driving modes, including Comfort, Eco Pro, and Sport.</p>

                <p>When BMW shifted to naming its coupes with even numbers, the former 3-Series Gran Coupe became the 4-Series Gran Coupe, launched in 2014.</p>
                <p>The 2018 BMW 4-Series Gran Coupe shared its platform with the 3-Series Sedan and aimed to rival the Audi A5 Sportback. While it offered five doors for convenience, it retained a coupe-like appearance. Inside, the front seats provided a genuine coupe feel, while the digital display and piano-black finishing enhanced the cabin's modernity. Engine options included turbocharged gasoline and diesel engines, paired with manual or automatic transmissions, and offered rear- or all-wheel drive.</p>

                <h3>2018-2020</h3>
                <p>In 2013, BMW introduced the 4 Series, essentially a rebadged version of the 3 Series. The change in nameplate distinguished the coupe and convertible models from the sedan. Despite this, both series shared the same platform, drivetrain, and interior features. The facelifted version debuted in 2017 and hit the market as a 2018 model.</p>
                <p>The 4 Series saw minimal exterior changes, but its new lighting system, featuring LED headlights, taillights, and fog lamps, was noteworthy. It came in four trim levels: Advantage, Sport Line, Luxury Line, and M Sport, with two exclusive colors, Snapper Rocks Blue and Sunset Orange. Inside, three new leather options were offered: Midnight Blue Dakota, Cognac Dakota, and White Dakota, along with refreshed interior trims in Carbon Aluminum, Light Fineline, and Pearl Chrome.</p>
                <p>There was a range of powertrains available, including gasoline and diesel engines. Gasoline options included a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder for the 420i (181 hp) and 430i (249 hp), and a 3.0-liter engine with 322 hp for the 440i. Diesel options like the 420d, 430d, and 435d were not available in the U.S.</p>

            <h2>Second generation</h2>
            <p>The second generation of the BMW 4 Series came out in 2020 with some changes. It got a new bold design, especially with its bigger grille, which got a lot of attention. Inside, it had nicer materials and more tech features for a luxurious feel. It still offered powerful engines and improved handling for a sporty drive. Overall, despite some mixed opinions about its looks, it continued to be a strong contender in the luxury coupe segment.</p>

                <h2>BMW 4-Series Convertible (G23)</h2>
                <h3>2020-2024</h3>
                <p>Just a few years ago, BMW switched the 4-Series convertible from a soft-top to a hard-top, which seemed like a good move. But in 2020, they did the opposite, changing back to a soft-top for the 4-Series convertible.</p>
                <p>BMW has a long history with open-top cars, going back to before WWII. They've always been good at combining driving fun with the open-air experience without sacrificing performance.</p>
                <p>In 2020, BMW made a change with the 4-Series convertible, switching from a hard-top to a soft-top. This move helped create a cleaner look for the car. The grille became more prominent, and the overall design featured sleek curves.</p>
                <p>Inside, there was enough space for four adults thanks to the soft-top taking up less room than a hard-top. The trunk also got bigger, offering more storage space. Plus, the soft-top could open or close even while driving at speeds of up to 31 mph in just 18 seconds.</p>
                <p>The 4-Series convertible came with a choice of four engines ranging from 184 hp to 374 hp, with rear- or all-wheel-drive options. All versions came with an 8-speed automatic transmission. And to meet stricter emissions standards, BMW added a mild-hybrid diesel version to the lineup.</p>

                <p>BMW decided to rename the Coupe version of the 3 Series as the 4-Series, reserving the 3 Series name for the four-door sedan. This move was part of BMW's strategy to improve its lineup, and it paid off.</p>
                <p>For the 2020 model year, BMW unveiled a brand-new 4-Series in June 2020, based on the concept car from September 2019's Frankfurt Motor Show. It had a striking appearance, especially with its huge kidney grille dominating the front. The car featured LED headlights as standard, with optional laser ones. Inside, it had sporty seats and a high-tech infotainment system compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android phones. The 4-Series came with a range of engines from 184 to 374 hp, with rear- or all-wheel-drive options. Diesel versions had a mild-hybrid system for better fuel efficiency and lower emissions.</p>

                <p>In mid-2021, BMW launched the 4 Series Gran Coupe, shortly after updating the X3 and X4 models.</p>
                <p>When BMW split the 3 Series into two models, customers weren't thrilled. Initially, the only difference between the two was the number of doors. Even the 3 Series Gran Coupe became the 4 Series Gran Coupe without many changes. But with the G26 generation, things changed.</p>
                <p>The 4 Series got attention for its big grille, resembling older BMW models. Its LED headlights looked aggressive, and it kept the frameless windows for all doors, keeping its coupe style. Inside, there were significant upgrades, with a larger infotainment screen and better seats. In the back, there was room for three adults, and the trunk space was impressive.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, there were sporty engine options, including a turbocharged four-cylinder for the base model and a turbocharged inline-six for the top-of-the-range M 440i.</p>

                <p>BMW fans eagerly awaited the facelift of the G82 4 Series, and in late January 2024, the German automaker revealed it. The update boasted some tech upgrades and a few aesthetic improvements</p>
                <p>Only a few purists were upset when the 4 Series replaced the 3 Series coupe, but things settled down quickly. The U.S. became BMW's top market, followed by Germany and China. The 2024 facelift of the 4 Series didn't drastically change its design but added tech upgrades.</p>
                <p>One of the most debated parts of the 4 Series was its front, with its tall kidney grilles. The 2024 model toned it down a bit with horizontal slats and new LED headlights. It had vents near the grille and air scoops for the brakes.</p>
                <p>From the side, it had standard 19-inch wheels and the same muscular look. Inside, it got new materials and BMW's latest iDrive OS 8.5 infotainment system with a touchscreen. It also had sporty seats and paddle shifters.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, it had familiar engines with turbo-diesel options. The big upgrade was the 48-volt system, boosting power instantly. The 2024 4 Series came with rear- or all-wheel drive, depending on the model.</p>

                <h2>BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe</h2>
                <h3>2024-Present</h3>
                <p>In January 2024, BMW updated the 4 Series Coupe and its convertible version. Three months later, they also refreshed the five-door coupe, the 4 Series Gran Coupe.</p>
                <p>The first generation of the 4 Series Gran Coupe, called the F36, debuted in 2014 at the Geneva Motor Show and was a hit with customers. When BMW introduced the second generation of the 4 Series in 2020, they also launched the updated version of the Gran Coupe in 2021. Despite challenges from the pandemic and chip shortages, it still sold well.</p>
                <p>For the facelifted version, BMW kept most of what made it successful but added some new updates. They redesigned the kidney grille, integrating it into a broader air intake, especially for versions with the M Package. New headlights were introduced with comma-like LEDs.</p>
                <p>The profile remained similar, but BMW added two new color options and updated the design of the 19-inch alloy wheels. At the back, new taillights featured laser diodes for a striking design, and a new diffuser emphasized the sporty character.</p>
                <p>Inside, BMW revamped the dashboard with two screens under curved glass, one for driving information and one for the iDrive 8.5 infotainment system. High-quality materials covered the dashboard, door cards, and center console. Depending on the model, there were either bucket seats or sports seats in the front and a bench seat in the back.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW used the same engines as before but added a mild-hybrid system for extra efficiency. The 430i gained more power thanks to engine improvements, while the 440i got a boost from a 48-volt starter generator, increasing its maximum power to 386 hp.</p>

                <p>In early 2024, BMW updated the first generation of the 4 Series convertible along with the coupe, enhancing both the exterior and the vehicle's foundation.</p>
                <p>In 2013, BMW split the 3 Series into two lines: the 4 Series for coupes, convertibles, and four-door coupes, and the 3 Series for sedans, hatchbacks, and wagons. In 2020, the 4 Series got its second generation, refreshed in 2024 with a new design, better tech, and electrified drivetrain.</p>
                <p>The new tall grille got criticism, but it came with horizontal slats and LED headlights. Vents on the apron and side scoops improved airflow. The convertible kept its profile, now with standard 19-inch wheels and optional styling packages.</p>
                <p>Inside, it had new materials and BMW's iDrive OS 8.5 infotainment. A curved glass panel covered the dashboard, with a touchscreen. The driver had a sport steering wheel with paddle shifters. Legroom was decent, but limited in the back.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, it had engines from before, with petrol and diesel options. The big upgrade was the 48-volt system with an integrated starter generator, boosting power instantly.</p>
