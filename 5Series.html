                <h3>1972-1981</h3>
                <p>BMW unveiled the first generation of the 5 Series in 1972, marking a significant step in re-establishing its status as a premium automaker.</p>
                <p>In the 1970s, after overcoming financial struggles, BMW introduced the Garmisch concept, which laid the groundwork for the first generation 5 Series (E12). Designed by Paul Bracq and Marcello Gandini, the E12 used advanced technology, including computer simulations for safety. This model, released in 1972, was highly successful until replaced by the E28 in 1981.</p>
                <p>The E12 featured a distinctive design with a four-headlight front, a broad grille, and a sporty look. It had a boxy profile with sleek lines, a raked windshield, and chrome accents. The interior included front bucket seats, a modern dashboard with a rectangular instrument cluster, and a rear bench for three passengers, though the middle seat was cramped due to the transmission tunnel.</p>
                <p>The E12 came with four- and six-cylinder engines ranging from 90 PS to 184 PS. In 1980, BMW introduced the M535i with a powerful 218 PS 3.5-liter engine. Power was delivered to the rear wheels through various manual and automatic transmissions.</p>

                <p>BMW introduced the third generation of the 5 Series, the E34, in December 1987, just under eight years after the second generation's debut in 1981.</p>
                <p>Italian designer Ercole Spada crafted the initial sketches for the third generation of the 5 Series in 1982, just a year after the second generation's debut. BMW aimed for a more radical overhaul this time, resulting in a longer, more comfortable car with more powerful engines. It was the first 5 Series to offer all-wheel drive and a station wagon variant from 1992. The E34 also saw the introduction of two M5 versions.</p>
                <p>While it retained the four-headlight styling, the front grille featured BMW's signature kidney grille design. The body boasted curved lines for improved aerodynamics, with body-colored door handles and mirrors. Inside, the driver-focused layout included an angled center stack and a trapezoidal instrument cluster.

                <p>The BMW 5 Series Touring, BMW's first station wagon based on the 5 Series, gained popularity for its sporty yet family-friendly design and ample cargo space. Offering options like all-wheel drive for the 2.5-liter gasoline engine and fuel-efficient turbodiesel engines, it impressed with speeds over 200 kph (124 mph). The Touring also boasted comfort and safety features, inheriting BMW's signature four-headlight styling and adopting a more curved body style compared to earlier models.

                <p>Two years after launching the fourth generation of the 5 Series, BMW introduced its station wagon variant, known as the Touring.</p>
                <p>When BMW introduced the E39 5 Series in 1995, it surprised customers with its unique front design, which eventually won appreciation. However, one downside was its limited luggage space, unlike its predecessor, the E34, which had a wagon version. This was rectified in 1997 with the second generation of the 5 Series Touring.</p>
                <p>The E39's front featured dual headlamps under a single glass cover and an aerodynamic bumper with integrated fog lamps. Its profile shared body panels with the sedan up to the B-pillars, with new rear doors to maintain consistency. It boasted a sporty rear with a tailgate and an independent rear window.</p>
                <p>Inside, the E39 showcased a dashboard with rounded corners and flowing lines. It housed a large instrument cluster with an onboard computer display. The front seats were bolstered, and the center console housed the gear stick. The rear bench seat was split-folding, offering ample trunk space.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW introduced all-aluminum engines for reduced weight. The E39 was the first BMW with fully aluminum suspension elements. Engine options included gasoline and turbodiesel paired with manual or automatic transmissions.</p>

                <p>By 2000, the BMW 5 Series was already a top-selling luxury sedan globally, boasting a wide range of engines and advanced features. Though lacking all-wheel drive like some rivals, its engineering prowess impressed. The 2001 facelift, known as the LCI, refreshed its appearance and marked a milestone as the first 5 Series to surpass 1.5 million units sold.</p>
                <p>At the front, notable changes included new headlights with circular daytime running lights, dubbed "angel eyes," and clear turn signals. The lower bumper featured a wider air intake and improved aerodynamics. From the side, a body-colored stripe replaced the black rubber one, contributing to a smoother profile. The curved roofline and iconic Hofmeister kink remained, maintaining BMW's signature style. At the rear, updated taillights added a modern touch.</p>
                <p>Inside, upholstery and trim options ranged from cloth to leather with wood accents. A new steering wheel with stereo controls was introduced, and an optional M-Sport package offered a sportier feel. The center stack housed an updated infotainment display with a wider ratio.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW revamped the engine lineup to meet Euro 3 emission standards, offering both gasoline and diesel options. Most models came with five-speed manuals or automatics, while select versions offered a six-speed manual in certain markets.</p>

                <p>In the early 1990s, BMW hired designer Chris Bangle to revamp its design language, but not everyone liked the bold new direction. The fifth generation of the 5 Series, the E60, faced criticism for its unconventional design, especially following the beloved E39. The controversial styling, including swept-back headlights and a double-bubble dashboard, led to slower sales compared to its predecessor. However, the E60 was praised for its advanced technology, smooth engines, and quality interiors. Despite the mixed reception, it introduced innovations like all-wheel drive options and features like active steering and adaptive headlights.</p>

Despite sharing the sedan's flaws and unusual design, it aimed to compete with rivals like the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Audi A6. The front sported distinctive swept-back headlights with "angel eyes" and a broad lower bumper. The E61 continued the tradition of sharing front parts with the sedan but extended behind the B-pillars to accommodate a spacious trunk. Inside, the dashboard design divided opinions, but the iDrive system offered convenient control. The rear seats folded for extra cargo space. Engine options included gasoline and turbodiesel, paired with manual or automatic transmissions, and some models featured all-wheel drive.</p>

                <h2>BMW 5 Series Touring (F11) LCI</h2>
                <h3>2013-2017</h3>
                <p>In 2013, BMW updated the entire sixth-generation 5 Series lineup, including the Touring version, to comply with the upcoming Euro 6 emission standards. This refresh ensured both the sedan and estate models were up to date with regulatory requirements.</p>
                <p>In 2013, BMW refreshed the sixth-generation 5 Series, including the Touring version, without introducing new engines until the following year. However, they made significant upgrades elsewhere. The exterior saw subtle changes, including standard bi-xenon headlights and redesigned lower bumpers. The profile remained similar, but new door mirrors with integrated LED turn signals were added. The interior received a new infotainment system, the NBT, with improved functionality. Options included a 10.25-inch TFT display and a split-folding rear bench seat. Under the hood, a variety of engines were available, paired with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic transmission, and rear or all-wheel drive systems. Later, the N-family engines replaced the previous ones, offering slightly more power.</p>

                <h3>2016-2020</h3>
                <p>After seven years, BMW replaced the sixth-generation 5 Series, the F10, with the G30 model. The G30 was more of an evolution than a revolution in terms of design.</p>
                <p>The seventh generation of the 5 Series was unveiled in late 2016 and launched in 2017. Despite looking like a heavily facelifted version of its predecessor, the F10, it was actually a completely new model built on the CLAR platform from the 7 Series. It boasted standard LED headlights, an elegant profile with short overhangs, and a refined interior with a free-floating iDrive display. The G30 offered a range of engines, both gasoline and turbodiesel, paired with an eight-speed automatic gearbox and available in rear- or all-wheel drive configurations.</p>

                <h2>BMW 5 Series Touring (G31)</h2>
                <h3>2017-2020</h3>
                <p>In February 2017, BMW introduced the station wagon version of the seventh generation 5 Series, shortly after unveiling its sedan counterpart at the North American International Auto Show.</p>
                <p>When BMW first introduced the 5 Series in 1972, there was no station wagon option. It wasn't until the third generation, two decades later, that the wagon version arrived and became quite popular, especially with some M-powered versions. In 2017, BMW launched the G30 5 Series sedan and its G31 Touring counterpart, continuing the design language of the previous generation. Built on the CLAR platform shared with the 7 Series and Rolls-Royce Ghost, the new models featured standard LED headlights and a sleeker grille design. The Touring model retained the sporty estate look, with a slightly reduced trunk space for style. Inside, there was a new iDrive infotainment system with a 10.25-inch touchscreen and gesture control. The Touring model offered ample space with a split-folding rear seat, expanding trunk capacity up to 1,700 liters. Under the hood, a range of engines including turbodiesel, gasoline, and hybrid options were available, paired with an improved eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>

                <p>Just three years after its debut in February 2017, BMW gave the 5 Series Touring a refresh for the 2020 model year. This update brought noticeable improvements to the vehicle's appearance, interior, and drivetrain.</p>
                <p>The seventh generation of the 5 Series, the G30/G31 lineup, was a hit for BMW, and they aimed to keep the momentum going with a refresh. Despite challenges like the 2020 pandemic and the microchip crisis, BMW went ahead with the update. The 2020 model featured slimmer LED headlights with L-shaped daytime running lights, and a broader kidney grille for a sleeker look. The cabin got a boost too, with options for a 12.3-inch driver display and an updated 10.25-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Under the hood, there were diesel, gasoline, and plug-in hybrid options, including the powerful 545e iPerformance with nearly 400 horsepower, capable of a rapid sub-five-second sprint to 62 mph.</p>
