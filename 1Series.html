            <h2>First generation</h2>
            <p>
                The first-generation BMW 1 Series, launched in 2004, was BMW's entry into the compact car scene. Unlike other small cars, it had rear-wheel drive, giving it a sportier feel. It came as a three-door or five-door hatchback, with a fancy interior and a choice of petrol or diesel engines. People liked it because it was fun to drive and still had that BMW luxury touch, even in a smaller size.</p>

            <h2>BMW 1 Series (E87)</h2>
            <h3>2004-2007</h3>
            <p>After two failed attempts with the 3 Series Compact, BMW created a new lineup called the 1 Series.</p>
            <p>In Europe, the compact segment was active, but most premium automakers ignored it. Only Audi competed with the A3. Mercedes failed with its A-Class minivan and C-Class Sport Coupe. In 2004, BMW introduced the 1 Series, a unique rear-wheel-drive, five-door hatchback.</p>
            <p>The 1 Series had a distinct look with sharp headlights and sculpted door panels. Its four-door version had split rear windows, and the tailgate was slightly tilted forward. Inside, the quality was similar to the 3 Series, with a sat-nav screen above the center stack and a familiar button layout. The front seats were bolstered for comfort, but the rear legroom was tight.</p>
            <p>BMW offered a range of engines, including efficient diesel versions.</p>

            <h2>BMW 1 Series Coupe (E82)</h2>
            <h3>2007-2010</h3>
            <p>In 2007, BMW surprised everyone by launching the 1 Series, a smaller vehicle than the 3 Series and the only premium coupe in the small-sized segment</p>
            <p>When BMW launched the first 3 Series in 1975, it was an instant hit due to its affordability, performance, and fuel efficiency. This success continued with the E30 model in 1982. However, as new generations grew in size and price, young customers could no longer afford them. To attract this audience back, BMW introduced the affordable 1 Series, including the three- and five-door hatchback versions and a two-door coupe (E87).</p>
            <p>The E87 had a distinctive front fascia, available in standard and M-package looks, both featuring headlights similar to the 3 Series. Its profile showed a raked windshield, arched greenhouse, frameless doors, and a short deck. The rear had a duck-tail trunk and a lower diffuser with single or double exhausts.</p>
            <p>Inside, the 1 Series offered comfort or M sports seats, a narrow instrument cluster, and various features based on the trim level, including single-zone or dual-zone climate control and an optional retractable infotainment screen. The rear seats were small, suitable only for short distances.</p>
            <p>Under the hood, the 1 Series came with a range of diesel and gasoline engines from 143 PS to 306 PS, with power sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed manual or automatic transmission.</p>

            <h3>2007-2011</h3>
            <p>In March 2007, BMW introduced a facelifted version of the 1 Series and added a new 3-door version.</p>
            <p>The E81 Series 1, seen as the successor to the 3 Series Compact, was introduced as a more affordable BMW option. Starting with the five-door model in 2004, it was well-received. After a facelift, a three-door version was added in May 2007.</p>
            <p>The three-door 1 Series had a less aggressive look, aiming to attract customers rather than intimidate them. It featured a smiling lower grille, sculptured door panels, the signature Hofmeister kink, and corner-mounted taillights.</p>
            <p>Unlike the five-door, the three-door had frameless windows, adding style. Inside, it had bolstered front seats and a 60/40 split-folding rear bench, suitable for short trips despite limited legroom.</p>
            <p>The facelifted E81 got the new N43 gasoline engine, with 1.6- or 2.0-liter options, and came with either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission.</p>

            <h3>2007-2011</h3>
            <p>In 2004, BMW introduced the 1 Series, a model that transformed the brand and was seen as the true successor to the legendary 3 Series E30 from the '80s. It was enhanced in 2007.</p>
            <p>The 2007 facelift of the BMW 1 Series introduced a new body style, interior, and engines, significantly updating the range. A new three-door version was added, featuring longer front doors and tilting front seats for easier rear access, and smaller rear side windows. The entire range got a new grille and bumper, larger kidney grilles for better airflow, and redesigned taillights.</p>
            <p>Inside, the dashboard was updated with a new infotainment system allowing iPod or USB connectivity but not Android Auto. There was a button to disable the automatic start-stop system. Rear passengers had limited legroom and headroom, and the trunk space was smaller than other compact hatchbacks.</p>
            <p>The engine range included eight diesel and gasoline options, with all but the base diesel available with either a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission.</p>

            <h3>2008-2010</h3>
            <p>In September 2007, BMW revealed a four-seat convertible with a soft-top roof, with full production starting in 2008.</p>
            <p>The BMW 1 Series E88 was a rear-wheel-drive car offering four petrol and one diesel engine options.</p>
            <p>Based on the coupe, the convertible was 12mm lower but had the same length, width, and wheelbase. Its soft-top roof operated at speeds up to 40 km/h, taking 22 seconds to open or close, slower than competitors like the Audi A3.</p>
            <p>Safety features included dual front and front seat-mounted side airbags, ABS, brake assist, ESC, corner braking control, and traction control.</p>
            <p>The climate control system adjusted airflow based on whether the roof was down, and the leather trim used Sun Reflective technology to reduce seat temperature by 20 degrees.</p>
            <p>Although marketed as a four-seater, the rear seats were more suitable for children due to limited legroom. The trunk offered 260 liters of space, enough for a weekend trip.</p>

            <p>BMW cleverly avoided naming the M version of the 1 Series as the M1 to prevent fan outrage. Instead, they introduced the 1 Series M Coupe as the top-performance model in the lineup.</p>
            <p>When BMW introduced the 1 Series, many saw it as the spiritual successor to the E30 3-Series. BMW later offered the 1 Series with an M treatment.</p>
            <p>The 1 Series M featured an aggressive design with functional upgrades like a new front bumper for cooling, enlarged fenders to accommodate wider wheels, and functional vents to reduce aerodynamic uplift. Inside, it had bucket seats for front occupants, limited rear space, and no sunroof for increased headroom.</p>
            <p>Under the hood, it housed a 3.0-liter inline-six engine with twin turbos, producing 335 hp (340 PS) and achieving 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) in under five seconds.</p>

            <p>The convertible came in two trims: the 128i and the 135i. The 128i had 17-inch alloys, automatic headlights, rain-sensing wipers, leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a 10-speaker audio system.</p>
            <p>It ran on a 3.0-liter 6-cylinder engine with 230 hp.</p>
            <p>The 135i added a tweaked suspension, 18-inch alloys, xenon headlights, and automatic climate control. Both trims had optional features like leather upholstery with sun-reflective treatment, sport seats, navigation, and Bluetooth connectivity.</p>

            <p>The second generation of the BMW 1 Series, launched in 2011, made some big changes. It shifted from rear-wheel drive to front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, which made it more fuel-efficient and practical. The design got sleeker, the interior got fancier with better tech, and it had more efficient engines. Even with the change in how it drove, it still kept that fun, sporty feel that people loved about the 1 Series.</p>

            <h3>2011-2015</h3>
            <p>In 2011, BMW launched the second generation of the 1 Series, maintaining its competitive edge in the premium car segment. Unlike its rivals, it was the only one with a rear-wheel-drive platform, which had its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
            <p>In the '90s, Audi's A3 faced little competition, with Mercedes-Benz offering the more MPV-like A-Class. BMW changed the game in 2004 with the 1 Series, a rear-wheel-drive premium small car. The second generation, the F20, even offered all-wheel-drive options.</p>
            <p>The 1 Series boasted a bold front grille and signature "angel-eye" daytime running lights. Depending on the version, air intakes were in the bumper. Inside, the front seats were a highlight, especially in the M-Package. The dashboard was clear, with an infotainment screen controlled via a rotary knob.</p>
            <p>Under the hood, BMW offered a range of engines with either six-speed manuals or eight-speed automatics, promising both efficiency and driving pleasure.</p>

            <p>The first generation of the 1 Series was a hit in the market, surprising its main competitor, Mercedes-Benz. Responding to customer feedback, BMW upgraded the 1 Series.</p>
            <p>The three-door model had a hot-hatchback look with its cab-rearward design and swept-back headlights. Inside, BMW improved material quality and added storage spaces. The front bucket seats were low-mounted, and the dashboard used soft materials. The range came with a standard infotainment unit but no touch screen. The 60/40 split-folding rear bench increased trunk space.</p>
            <p>BMW offered a wide range of engines, from 101 hp to 320 hp, paired with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic. Some versions also had all-wheel-drive options.</p>

            <p>In 2015, BMW gave the second generation of the 1 Series a significant facelift. They added features like automatic climate control, rain sensors, BMW Radio Professional, and standard iDrive across the range. The 6.5-inch color display, integrated into the dashboard, looked like it belonged there from the start.</p>
            <p>The long hood, big wheelbase, and short overhangs give the vehicle a sporty look, which is more than just aesthetic in certain versions. The kidney grille is larger, and optional reshaped headlights come with full LED lights, adding to the aggressive front bumper.</p>
            <p>Under the hood, there's a wide range of powertrains with manual or automatic transmissions. The 1 Series now offers the 8-speed Steptronic gearbox from Aisin.</p>
            <p>There are five petrol and five diesel engines available, all with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology. The BMW M135i M leads in sports performance with a 326 hp inline-6 engine. The most fuel-efficient is the BMW 116d EfficientDynamics Edition, boasting 116 hp and a consumption of 3.4 liters per 100 kilometers (69.1 mpg-US).

            <p>For both the 3-door and 5-door versions, BMW added features like automatic climate control, rain sensors, BMW Radio Professional, and standard iDrive across the range. The 6.5-inch color display is integrated into the dashboard as standard.</p>
            <p>The 3-door version retains its long doors, requiring rear passengers to climb in behind the front seats. However, the spacious wheelbase allows for decent entry.</p>
            <p>Under the hood, there's a wide range of powertrains with manual or automatic transmissions. The 1 Series now offers the 8-speed Steptronic gearbox from Aisin for the first time.</p>

            <p>In terms of tech, BMW introduced the latest iDrive infotainment system. They offer a Professional Navigation System with an 8.8-inch touchscreen, controllable by voice or the iDrive controller with a touch-sensitive knob.</p>

                <p>BMW introduced the 1 Series Sedan in China to compete with the Mercedes-Benz CLA.</p>
                <p>In the U.S. and Europe, the Mercedes-Benz CLA was the only small-class premium option, but BMW introduced the 1 Series Sedan in China to compete, driven by high sales in the region. Chinese customers preferred smaller vehicles for heavy traffic.</p>
                <p>The 1 Series Sedan, with its front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, had a mid-size wheelbase. It featured aggressive headlights, a wide "kidney-grille," fluid lines, and 3-Series style taillights. Inside, it shared parts with the 1 Series hatchback, including a black dashboard and floating touch-screen. Seats varied from standard to sports, with cloth or leather options, and a split-folding rear bench.</p>
                <p>BMW offered three engine options (136 hp to 231 hp), all paired with automatic transmissions.</p>
