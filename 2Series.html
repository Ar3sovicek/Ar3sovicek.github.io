                <h2>BMW 2 Series</h2>
                <h3>2013-2017</h3>
                <p>Initially, BMW offered the sportier 1 Series Coupe based on the 1 Series hatchback. The 2 Series replaced the 1 Series Coupe, but BMW made more changes than just the name.</p>
                <p>The 2013 BMW 2 Series, available only as a coupe, featured significant styling and mechanical upgrades, offering more interior room and cargo space.</p>
                <p>With sharp headlights and redesigned taillights, it had an attractive coupe look with a saloon-style trunk. Inside, the high-quality, premium design included soft-touch materials and plenty of standard equipment. The cabin had ample storage, including cupholders and door bins, and the rear passenger space was spacious for a coupe, with a central armrest and cupholders.</p>
                <p>Standard features included automatic climate control, USB and Bluetooth connectivity, a multi-function steering wheel, and rain-sensing wipers. Optional features included leather upholstery, parking sensors, and large alloy wheels.</p>
                <p>The 2 Series offered various driving modes and a great suspension, providing a sporty driving experience. The M235i model, for thrill-seekers, could reach 100 km/h in 4.8 seconds with an 8-speed automatic transmission. All engines could be paired with a 6-speed manual transmission at no extra cost, though the automatic gearbox was standard.</p>

                <h3>2014-2017</h3>
                <p>The BMW 2 Series is the only premium compact convertible on the market. Introduced in 2014, the open-top version added a soft-top, some weight, and extra charm.</p>
                <p>The BMW 2 Series convertible features a seven-layer soft top for soundproofing and thermal insulation. It's electrically powered and retracts in 20 seconds. The car looks good with the roof up.</p>
                <p>Inside, standard features include the iDrive and navigation system. However, the rear seats are cramped, suitable only for children, and unusable with the rear wind deflector installed.</p>
                <p>The 2 Series offers various gasoline and diesel engines, paired with a 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission. The most powerful is the 326 hp M235i with a twin-scroll turbo engine.</p>
                <p>Designed for open-air driving, the car allows front occupants to converse comfortably with the windows up and top down.</p>

                <h2>BMW 2 Series Convertible (F23) LCI</h2>
                <h3>2017-Present</h3>
                <p>BMW introduced the first generation of the 2 Series as a coupe in 2013, followed by a convertible version in 2014. Both were refreshed in 2017.</p>
                <p>The BMW 2 Series started as a re-badged 1 Series Coupe, renamed because BMW decided all coupes should have even numbers. The 2 Series Convertible shared many components with the 1 Series and received its last update before a new generation in 2019.</p>
                <p>From 2017, the 2 Series featured bi-LED headlights and optional LED fog lights. The rear had standard LED L-shaped taillights. The updated interior included a new dashboard, a top-mounted infotainment screen, and an iDrive controller on the center console. Customers had a choice of new upholstery fabrics and leather designs.</p>
                <p>The 2 Series Convertible offered eight engine options (136 hp to 340 hp) with either a 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission, and rear- or all-wheel drive.</p>

                <h2>BMW 2 Series (F22) LCI</h2>
                <h3>2017-2021</h3>
                <p>In 2017, BMW introduced a facelifted version, known as LCI (Life Cycle Impulse), after four years on the market, along with a revised engine lineup.</p>
                <p>After introducing the 1 Series in 2004, BMW realized the coupe appealed to different customers than the hatchback, leading to the creation of the 2 Series as a sportier, less practical two-door coupe or convertible. The 2017 model featured a restyled exterior and upgraded interior, making it more appealing.</p>
                <p>The front fascia received new bi-LED headlights and hexagonal daytime running lights. The M-package offered wider air scoops to cool the front brakes, new side skirts, and L-shaped LED taillights.</p>
                <p>Inside, the 2 Series offered fabric bucket seats or leather sports seats, an analog instrument cluster with a color display, and an 8.8” infotainment screen controlled by the iDrive system. The upgraded infotainment unit included BMW ConnectedDrive, real-time traffic information, and Apple CarPlay connectivity. The rear bench seat was cramped, and the trunk held 390 liters (13.7 cu-ft.) of storage.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW offered seven turbocharged engines (gasoline and diesel) with three, four, or six cylinders, paired with six-speed manuals or eight-speed automatics. Some models, like the 220i, 230i, 225d, and M240i xDrive Coupe, were only available with automatics. Customers could choose between rear or all-wheel-drive systems depending on the engine and options.</p>

                <p>BMW unveiled the 2022 2 Series Coupe at the 2021 Goodwood Festival of Speed. Unlike its front-wheel-drive hatchback sibling, the two-door version retained its traditional rear-wheel-drive system.</p>
                <p>BMW changed its naming system, using even numbers for coupes and odd numbers for four- or five-door models. Thus, the 1 Series Coupe became the 2 Series, retaining RWD or AWD.</p>
                <p>The 2 Series Coupe featured a unique front fascia with a flat, broad grille and slim LED headlights. Wider tires fit its enlarged fenders, with options up to 255/35 R 19 rear and 225/40 R 19 front.</p>
                <p>Inside, it offered 2021 technology, including Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, and an 8.8" standard touch-screen (with a 10.25" optional). A 12.3" digital instrument panel displayed car info, navigation, and music. It had front bucket seats, a rear bench with limited space, and a 390-liter trunk.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, it had gasoline and turbo-diesel engine options: two inline-four engines (one gasoline, one turbo-diesel) and a turbocharged inline-six.</p>

                <p>The 2 Series Active Tourer, introduced in 2014, was BMW's first front-wheel-drive car, causing controversy. BMW fans would have considered a front-wheel-drive MPV by BMW a joke before its release.</p>
                <p>In 2014, BMW introduced the 2 Series Active Tourer, marking its first venture into front-wheel-drive cars. This move combined the practicality of an MPV with BMW's sporty driving experience, causing quite a stir among automotive enthusiasts. The 2 Series Active Tourer featured a high driving position and seven seats, but also packed a surprising 231 hp 2.0-liter engine.</p>
                <p>Designed with versatility in mind, the interior included sliding and foldable rear seats (configured 40:20:40), ample storage spaces, and a refreshed center console. The vehicle also introduced a new generation of modular engines, starting as small as 1.5 liters.</p>
                <p>All engines at launch met the latest EU6 CO2 emissions standards and were paired with either new 6-speed automatic or manual gearboxes, or the more common 8-speed ZF automatic unit. The 2 Series Active Tourer made its official debut at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. This model was ideal for those who appreciated BMW's driving dynamics but needed more room and practicality.</p>

                <p>The BMW 2-Series Gran Tourer was BMW's first modern attempt to enter the small MPV market, offering more room and luxury in a premium vehicle.</p>
                <p>The Gran Tourer was the seven-seat version of the 2014 BMW 2-Series Active Tourer. It was more related to the MINI hatchback and featured a front-wheel-drive architecture instead of the rear-wheel drive of the regular 2-Series.</p>
                <p>The front design included the classic kidney grille but had calmer headlights. The raked A-pillars and longer roofline gave it a typical MPV profile. The interior used high-quality materials similar to the 2-Series, with a flat dashboard and an optional 6.5” color display for the infotainment system, controlled by the iDrive knob. The last row of seats was foldable and located in the trunk area.</p>
                <p>The 2-Series Gran Tourer offered front or all-wheel drive and a range of engines with three or four cylinders, producing between 116 hp and 192 hp. It did not have a plug-in hybrid option.</p>

                <p>BMW management supported the 2-Series Gran Tourer project, knowing the market needed a small vehicle that could carry more people. Competing with Mercedes-Benz's A-Class and B-Class, the Gran Tourer offered enough room for five adults and two children due to its Mini-based platform with a transverse engine.</p>
                <p>The facelift included a new front fascia with a larger grille and new headlights. Inside, the center stack was driver-focused, with new materials and a BMW M-Performance package. Longer seat cushions added comfort, and trim levels included Luxury Line, Sport Line, and M Sport packages.</p>
                <p>The powertrain options expanded to include three- and four-cylinder engines and a plug-in hybrid, with manual or automatic transmissions, including a new 7-speed dual-clutch option.</p>
