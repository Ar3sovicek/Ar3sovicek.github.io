            <h2>First generation</h2>
            <p>The first generation of the BMW 6 Series, called the E24, came out in 1976 and lasted until 1989. It was BMW's first luxury grand tourer, blending performance and style. With its sleek design, including the iconic shark-nose front end, it came in coupe and convertible versions. Powered by strong inline-six engines, it offered a smooth ride and advanced features like ABS brakes. The E24 was loved for its luxury, comfort, and great driving experience.</p>

                <h2>BMW 630 CS (E24)</h2>
                <h3>1976-1979</h3>
                <p>When BMW rolled out the first generation of the 6-series, it was a bit of a risk. But the stunning coupe turned out to be a hit, proving the gamble paid off.</p>
                <p>BMW faced the challenge of replacing the aging E9 series, but it had a strong foundation with the platform from the 1972 E12 5-series and the design language of the 1971 3-series. The 6-series emerged as a luxurious grand tourer coupe, designed by Paul Braq with distinctive features like a shark-nose front and a sporty chrome bumper. It stood out in its segment, with Mercedes-Benz lacking a comparable offering and the Jaguar XJS being pricier. The 6-series shared design elements with the 7-series but had frameless doors and only two rear seats. Inside, the layout included a driver-centric center stack and a traditional instrument cluster with four dials. Initially powered by a 3.0-liter inline-six engine, BMW later enhanced the 6-series with more power and features to attract affluent buyers.</p>

                <h2>BMW 635 CSi (E24)</h2>
                <h3>1978-1989</h3>
                <p>The BMW 635 CSI, launched in 1979, was the top-performing version of the first generation 6 Series coupe. It outpaced and offered superior comfort compared to other GT cars of its time.</p>
                <p>After the success of the BMW 3.0 CS in the early '70s, BMW needed a successor. Paul Braq designed a new model based on the platform of the BMW 5-Series, allowing for 4 and 6 cylinder engines. It was designed to be a performance coupe, so BMW opted for inline-six engines only. While it shared some design cues with the 7-Series, it was more of a blend between the 5-Series platform and 7-Series styling.</p>
                <p>The first generation 6-Series shared similarities in design with the 7-Series, like the shark-nose front and descending trunk line. However, it had frameless windows and only two rear seats. Inside, it had a driver-centric dashboard with four dials for temperature, tachometer, speedometer, and fuel level.</p>
                <p>Under the hood was a 3.5-liter inline-six engine mated to a standard 5-speed gearbox. It offered a broad torque range, providing smooth performance. An automatic transmission variant, the 635 CSI A, was also available.</p>

                <p>In 1984, BMW took the powerful engine from the M1 supercar and placed it in a 6 Series, enhancing its brakes and suspension. This transformation resulted in the creation of one of Germany's most iconic vehicles: the M635 CSi.</p>
                <p>The M-badged version of the 6 Series was both more powerful and luxurious than its counterparts. It debuted in 1984, boasting over 60 additional horsepower compared to the regular 635 CSi. Despite sharing the same exterior as the standard 6 Series, it had distinct features like four headlamps, a lower spoiler, and rectangular fog lamps. Inside, it offered bolstered front seats, individual rear chairs, leather upholstery, and an onboard diagnosis system. Under the hood, it housed the engine from the BMW M1, delivering robust performance to the rear wheels via an LSD.</p>

            <p>The second generation of the BMW 6 Series, called the E63/E64, was made from 2003 to 2010. It was a modern take on the luxury grand tourer, focusing on performance and luxury. With a sleek design and powerful engines, including V8 and V10 options, it offered both style and speed. The E63/E64 introduced advanced technology like BMW's iDrive system for convenience.

                <p>The first generation of the 6-Series, produced from 1976 to 1989, was well-received by customers for its sleek design. It wasn't until 14 years later that BMW unveiled the second generation of the 6-Series.</p>
                <p>The second generation of the 6-Series, unveiled in 2003 under the Chris Bangle era, sparked controversy with its rear design, dubbed the "Bangle Butt" by fans. Despite this, it marked the return of the 6-Series.</p>
                <p>Featuring small headlights and a wide grille, the front end had a distinctive look. The aerodynamically designed bumper housed three air intakes for engine and brake cooling. Sculpted doors and fenders added to its dynamic appearance.</p>
                <p>Inside, it offered a luxurious GT-style experience with front bucket seats and limited rear space for up to three passengers. The infotainment system was controlled via a rotary knob on the center console.</p>
                <p>Engine options ranged from a 3.0-liter to a powerful 5.0-liter V10 in the M6 variant. Transmission choices included a 6-speed manual for the base model, a 6-speed automatic for the 4.4-liter, and a 7-speed single-clutch for the M6.</p>

                <p>The second generation of the 6 Series finally got its convertible version in 2004, ending the long wait since the original model in 1977.</p>
                <p>The E64 6 Series convertible was BMW's first soft-top Gran Turismo, offering a blend of luxury and performance. Its design received mixed reviews, particularly regarding the headlights. Inside, it boasted a host of features, including iDrive and optional head-up display. While the front seats were spacious and adjustable, the rear seats offered limited legroom, though a wind-stopper could enhance comfort. Engine options included an inline 6 and two V8s, available with manual or automatic transmission, but all were rear-wheel drive only.</p>

                <p>BMW delighted fans with the return of the second-generation 6 Series in 2004, followed by the convertible's debut at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show. Despite its controversial design, the facelift in 2007 brought only minor changes, such as tweaked headlights and a revised bumper. Inside, the gear selector received an upgrade, while the iDrive system saw improvements. Engine options expanded, including a turbo-diesel variant for the European market and a more powerful 3.0-liter gasoline engine.</p>

                <p>In 2007, BMW rolled out a mid-cycle upgrade for the 6-Series, tweaking both its exterior and interior while also making significant changes under the hood. Visually, it was challenging to spot the differences from the previous model year, with subtle changes to the bumpers and headlights. However, the rear lights were updated to LED, and the third brake light moved to the trunk-lid. Inside, minor tweaks were made to the climate control and iDrive system. Two new engines were introduced: a 3.0-liter turbodiesel for Europe (635d) and a 3.0-liter gasoline engine (630i). The V8 was upgraded to a 4.8-liter, while the M6 boasted a powerful 5.0-liter V10.</p>

                <p>In 2011, BMW launched the third generation of the 6 Series as a coupe, followed by the debut of a four-door coupe variant called the Gran Coupe in the subsequent year.</p>
                <p>BMW crafted the 6 Series to embody the essence of a Grand Touring vehicle, blending stylish luxury with powerful performance. The F12 model, launched in 2011, showcased sleek elliptical headlights and a profile exuding elegance and aggression, defining its grand touring character.</p>
                <p>Inside, comfort was paramount, with plush, adjustable bucket seats designed for long journeys. The dashboard boasted a floating 7" infotainment screen, upgradeable to 10.2", alongside a rounded instrument cluster.

                <p>Amidst the looming global economic crisis in 2007, BMW unveiled the CS concept car, previewing a four-door coupe design. However, it took five more years for the production version, named the 6 Series Gran Coupe, to hit the market.</p>
                <p>Essentially, the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupe was a four-door version of the 6 Series coupe, built on the 5-Series platform but with larger dimensions. It entered the luxury four-door coupe segment, following the footsteps of Mercedes-Benz CLS and Audi A7.</p>
                <p>The exterior resembled the 6 Series coupe, featuring aggressive styling with LED headlights and a wide front grille for better engine cooling. Inside, it boasted a luxurious cabin with comfortable seats and high-quality materials. The car offered optional features like a head-up display projected onto the windshield. Despite being labeled as a 4+1 seater, it was more practical for four occupants, with the rear center console extending to the back.</p>
                <p>Engine options included both diesel and gasoline variants, with the option for all-wheel-drive on some models, while others were rear-wheel-drive only.</p>

                <p>Designed as a luxurious grand tourer, the 6 Series was soon complemented by a convertible version to rival its premium competitors. Featuring the iconic "shark nose" design, it boasted aggressive styling with swept-back headlights and a prominent grille. Its profile included angled A-pillars for aerodynamics, and all side windows could be rolled down. Inside, the cabin exuded luxury with leather and high-quality materials, while the front seats were bolstered for stability during high-speed driving. The rear seats, however, lacked legroom due to the retractable roof mechanism. Under the hood, a range of powerful gasoline and turbo-diesel engines was offered, with optional all-wheel drive on select models.</p>

                <h2>BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo (G32 LCI)</h2>
                <h3>2020-Present</h3>
                <p>The 6-Series Gran Turismo got positive feedback when it debuted in 2017. In 2020, BMW revealed an updated version of the car.</p>
                <p>In 2020, BMW faced the challenge of releasing a facelift for the 6-Series GT amid a global pandemic and economic strain. Despite its name, the 6-Series GT was more of a successor to the 5-Series GT, featuring coupe-style lines and a 5-door hatchback design.</p>
                <p>The facelift brought refined front and rear shapes, aligning with BMW's design language. The prominent kidney grille and LED headlights made a bold statement, though some felt the grille was oversized. Inside, the car offered ample space for five passengers and increased trunk capacity of 600 liters (21.1 cu-ft). The cockpit featured a tilted touch-screen display atop the dashboard and a digital instrument cluster.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, new Euro 6d engines were introduced, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Options included rear or all-wheel-drive, with power ranging from 190 hp for the base inline-four engine to 340 hp for the inline-six turbodiesel unit. All models were equipped with a mild-hybrid system for improved efficiency.</p>
