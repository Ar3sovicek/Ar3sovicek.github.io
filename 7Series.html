                <h2>BMW 7 Series (E23)</h2>
                <h3>1977-1986</h3>
                <p>The first generation of the BMW 7-Series, launched in 1977, followed the New Six concept introduced in 1968 with the E3 bodywork.</p>
                <p>The first BMW 7-Series, launched in 1977, featured only six-cylinder engines and had a modern design with an angled "shark nose" fascia. Although a prototype with a V12 engine was created, it remained unique. The design moved away from previous trends, keeping only the four rounded headlights. The car had a flat, wide hood, a simple greenhouse, and a descending trunk lid, with chromed bumpers. In the 1983 facelift, the kidney grille was enlarged, and new plastic-covered bumpers were added.</p>
                <p>Inside, the 7-Series introduced innovations like service-control lights, climate control, and an onboard computer. The base model had cloth seats and a manual gearbox, while higher trims included a sunroof, power windows, leather seats, and power locks. Initially, the engines had four-barrel Solex carburetors, but later all were upgraded to Bosch fuel injection systems. The most powerful version, the 286 hp 754i, featured an inline-six engine with a turbocharger.</p>

                <p>The BMW 7-Series E32, introduced in 1986, was the first V12 car produced in Germany since WWII and was the most technologically advanced vehicle on the market at that time.</p>
                <p>The battle for the luxury segment between Mercedes-Benz and BMW intensified when BMW introduced the second generation of the 7-Series in June 1986. Initially powered by an inline-six engine, the lineup later expanded to include V8 and V12 options.</p>
                <p>Design work began in 1979, and the final project was ready by 1984, but production started in 1986. Over 300,000 units were produced until April 1994.</p>
                <p>The 7-Series featured a driver-oriented cabin, making it popular among executives who drove their own cars. It included technological advancements like Automatic Stability Control (ASC) and a driver-tilted central console. For rear passengers, a long-wheelbase version offered ample legroom.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, there were various engine choices. The V12 was known for performance, while the six-cylinder units were praised for fuel efficiency, especially with the 5-speed manual transmission.</p>

                <h3>1994-1998</h3>
                <p>The third generation of the BMW 7-Series was highly sought after and is considered by many fans to be the best 7-Series ever made. It bridged the gap between old technology and the digital era.</p>
                <p>The E38 generation was the last BMW 7-Series available with a manual transmission and the first with a V12 engine. It combined comfort, luxury, and sportiness, and was notably fuel-efficient with the 2.5-liter diesel engine (not available in North America).</p>
                <p>The car had a low height similar to the Jaguar XJ series, dual headlamps with halogen or Xenon lights, and came in short or long wheelbase versions. An extra-long wheelbase model, the L7, was available for state and government officials.</p>
                <p>Inside, it had five seats, but only two rear passengers could sit comfortably due to the low cabin height and high transmission tunnel. Options included various sound systems and an optional telephone.</p>
                <p>Engine choices ranged from a 2.5-liter turbodiesel to a 5.4-liter V8. Most versions offered a 5- or 6-speed manual transmission, with a 5-speed automatic available for all models.</p>

                <p>The 1998 facelift of the third-generation BMW 7-Series included revised headlights, new taillights, sportier suspension, new wheels, and a torque converter. BMW also introduced a new sports package, initially for the 740i, later available for 740iL and 750iL variants. The 728i engines were upgraded with variable valve timing.</p>
                <p>New features included automatic climate control, front side airbags, a standard Head Protection System, and DSC. The facelift also added "Active Comfort Seats" for fatigue reduction and made head airbags standard.</p>
                <p>The 740iL's 4.4-liter V8 engine had increased torque to 440 Nm. The 7-Series offered a generous 500 L trunk space, reliability, comfort, and luxury, making it ideal for long family trips. The E38 7-Series was discontinued in 2001, replaced by the fourth-generation model.</p>

                <p>The fourth-generation BMW 7-Series was both highly criticized for its look and widely loved. Despite the mixed reactions, it outsold its predecessors.</p>
                <p>The E65 BMW 7-Series, designed by Chris Bangle, introduced a new "flame-surfacing" style, making the car look different from various angles. Though it appeared bulkier than its predecessor, it was the most technologically advanced car of its time, even winning an award in Japan.</p>
                <p>The E65/E66 had a larger grille and a front bumper designed to highlight the headlights. The rear quarter-panel's arch did not align with the trunk lid. Inside, it featured a revolutionary infotainment system controlled by a rotary knob, developed with Nokia, and a double-bulged dashboard.</p>
                <p>The long-wheelbase version (E66) offered ample legroom in the back. Available with a range of gasoline and diesel engines from inline-six to V12, it was the first BMW 7-Series to come exclusively with an automatic transmission.</p>

                <p>Despite its polarizing design, the BMW 7 Series (E65/E66) became the best-selling 7 Series ever. Some attribute its success to the advanced technologies, while others believe the bold design attracted new customers who no longer favored the classic look.</p>
                <p>To address criticism of Chris Bangle's design, BMW updated the 7 Series' appearance. The front headlamp design was softened, and the rear end was smoothed out with changes to the taillights and panel.</p>
                <p>Inside, BMW introduced an upgraded iDrive infotainment system with more features, including Bluetooth and navigation. The system's rotary knob allowed access to numerous functions. Paddle shifters were added to the steering wheel, and the long-wheelbase version (E66) offered business-class legroom.</p>
                <p>BMW also enhanced the engine lineup, including a 4.8-liter engine from the X5 4.8is, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission across the range.</p>

The design featured headlights integrated with the bumper, distinct kidney grilles, and long, straight lines emphasizing its length.</p>
                <p>Inside, the 7-Series introduced a new interior with horizontal dashboard lines extending to the door panels.

The exterior changes included new LED headlights, a redesigned bumper, and a radiator grille with fewer slats. At the rear, the LED taillights were connected by a chromed strip.</p>
                <p>Inside, significant changes were seen with an optional 10.25" black screen replacing analog gauges in the instrument cluster. This allowed for customizable interior lighting themes corresponding to different driving modes selected by the driver.</p>
                <p>For rear-seat passengers, depending on trim levels and options, control over music and navigation systems was possible via an iDrive rotary knob located in the center armrest. The new 750d xDrive and BMW 730d models were equipped to meet Euro 6 emission standards.</p>
