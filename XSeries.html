                <h2>BMW X1 (E84)</h2>
                <h3>2009-2012</h3>
                <p>The newest and smallest member of the lineup, the X1, was the missing piece in BMW's X range.</p>
                <p>The X1's exterior design is reminiscent of its bigger brother, the X3, with taillights and headlights inspired by the 7-Series from 2008. Built on the 3 Series platform, it offers ample cabin space and great cargo capacity.</p>
                <p>The interior features high-quality materials and advanced technology, providing good headroom and legroom for all passengers. The luggage compartment can expand from 420 L to 1,350 L with the rear seats folded.</p>
                <p>For safety, the X1 includes Dynamic Stability Control, optional Performance Control, and frontal and side airbags. Optional features include xenon headlights, adaptive headlights, and a high-beam assistant.</p>
                <p>The X1 also comes with the latest BMW iDrive system and optional Business and Professional navigation. It offers precise handling and good steering feedback, though the steering can be heavy at lower speeds.</p>
                <p>Starting at $43,000, the X1 offers many optional features, though they can be pricey.</p>

                <h2>BMW X1 (E84)</h2>
                <h3>2012-2015</h3>
                <p>For the 2014 model year, BMW refreshed the X1 lineup, improving both its appearance and drivetrain.</p>
                <p>The X1, based on the E90 3 Series platform, was introduced in 2009 as a premium small-sized crossover. By 2012, after selling over 275,000 units, BMW unveiled a facelifted version at the New York International Auto Show, boosting sales to over 150,000 units for 2013 and 2014. The E84 model was highly successful.</p>
                <p>The facelift included a revised front fascia with new headlights, grille, and a redesigned lower bumper with a larger painted area. LED daytime running lights were added to the Xenon light package, and turn signals were integrated into the door mirrors.</p>
                <p>Inside, changes included a new dashboard and center console for automatic transmission models, with new knobs, switches, and a joystick-like gear selector. However, the back seat still had limited room due to the tall transmission tunnel.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW introduced a new inline-four engine, available with or without a turbocharger.</p>

                <h2>BMW X1</h2>
                <h3>2016-2019</h3>
                <p>In 2016, BMW introduced the second generation of its smallest SUV, the X1, which was no longer based on the 3 Series platform.</p>
                <p>The first generation of the X1 was popular, but customers complained about the cramped interior. To address this, BMW switched to the UKL2 platform, shared with MINI, for the second generation introduced in 2016. This platform allowed for a transversely-mounted engine, resulting in a shorter nose and overhang, and a roomier interior with wider front and rear doors.</p>
                <p>The front design featured an enlarged kidney grille and headlights similar to the X3. Inside, the new X1 offered more space, with bolstered front seats and a tall center console housing the gear selector. The dashboard included two large dials and an LCD for onboard information, while the infotainment screen was controlled by a rotary dial. The new architecture provided better legroom and trunk space.</p>
                <p>The second-generation X1 came with either front or all-wheel drive, and transmission options included a six-speed manual, an eight-speed automatic, a six-speed automatic, or a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox, depending on the version.</p>

                <h3>2019-2022</h3>
                <p>The BMW X1 is crucial for BMW, being its top-selling model globally in 2018. After four years, it received a facelift. The updated X1 features a bold front bumper with larger air intakes. The front end is completely redesigned, highlighted by a larger BMW kidney grille and new LED headlights.</p>
                <p>Inside the cabin, the X1 combines style with advanced technology. It offers three trim versions: Sport Line, xLine, and M Sport, each enhancing the base equipment. Comfort is a priority for all seats, with the rear bench featuring a 60:40 split and individual sliding seat surfaces that can move up to 13 cm (5.1 in).</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW provides a range of engines including three and four-cylinder options, both turbocharged gasoline and turbodiesel. There's also a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) variant. The entry-level model features a 1.5-liter three-cylinder turbodiesel paired with a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox, available in front-wheel-drive (sDrive). At the top end, the X1 xDrive25i boasts a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine delivering 231 hp, achieving 0-100 kph (62 mph) in 6.5 seconds.</p>
                <p>For efficiency, the xDrive25e Plug-in Hybrid combines a 1.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine with a 70kW electric motor, producing a total of 224 hp.</p>

                <p>BMW launched the third generation of its smallest SAV, the X1, in 2022. It became the most compact and affordable crossover in BMW's lineup.</p>
                <p>BMW introduced the first generation of the X1 in 2009, which proved successful despite its narrow interior due to its longitudinal engine platform. The second generation in 2015 addressed these space limitations, and by 2022, the X1 gained further popularity.</p>
                <p>The 2022 X1 features swept-back headlights similar to the 3 Series and a more proportionate front grille. Its profile includes an ascending beltline ending with the distinctive "Hofmeister Kink," giving it a SUV-like appearance over a station wagon.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X1 boasts an elegant cabin with a curved display in front of the driver and an integrated infotainment unit atop the center stack, enhancing the perception of a unified panel. The shift to a front-wheel-drive architecture and transverse-mounted engine allows for a more spacious interior.</p>
                <p>The 2022 X1 lineup offers front or rear-wheel drive, with options for gasoline or turbo-diesel engines, all benefiting from 48v mild-hybrid technology.</p>

                <h2>BMW X2 (F39)</h2>
                <h3>2018-2023</h3>
                <p>The BMW X2, based on the MINI Countryman platform, is the smallest Sports Activity Coupe in BMW's lineup, serving as the coupe version of the X1 SUV.</p>
                <p>The crossover market saw rapid growth following the SUV boom, prompting BMW to enter with the first generation of the X1 in 2008, followed by the second generation in 2015. For the 2015 model, BMW also introduced a sporty version, the X2.</p>
                <p>Unlike its sibling the X1, the X2 featured a distinct design with a taller front bumper and narrower headlights. Its profile resembled more of a hatchback with elevated ground clearance, and notably, it sported BMW's logo on the D-pillars, a unique feature in BMW's recent lineup.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X2 accommodated four adults comfortably, though rear seat space was more limited due to its sloping roofline. Built on a front-wheel-drive platform, it offered better legroom for all passengers but compromised on rear headroom. The dashboard included a floating infotainment screen atop the center stack and a classic instrument cluster with two round dials complemented by a TFT screen for additional details. Despite a smaller trunk, it featured underfloor storage for added convenience.</p>
                <p>Engine options for the X2 included diesel, gasoline, and hybrid variants, paired with either a standard 6-speed manual or automatic transmission. Both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive configurations were available, catering to a wide range of driving preferences.</p>

                <p>BMW launched the second generation of its smallest Sport Activity Coupe (SAC), the X2, in 2023 for the 2024 model year. This new iteration continued the X2's success story as a stylish, small-sized crossover ideal for urban environments. Despite sharing its platform with the X1 and Mini Countryman, the coupe-shaped X2 attracted a dedicated customer base, prompting BMW to introduce its successor.</p>
                <p>The 2023 X2 distinguished itself with a sportier design compared to the X1. Its front fascia featured a wider kidney grille with optional surrounding LED strip, flanked by LED headlights or adaptive LED options. Depending on the package, it offered different bumper styles, including a sporty M-package with a broad center intake and functional scoops. The sloped roofline and low greenhouse emphasized its athletic crossover profile, while the larger dimensions provided a more spacious interior and cargo area compared to its predecessor.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X2 offered bolstered front seats and a bench seat for two in the rear, complemented by a digital instrument cluster and iDrive infotainment touchscreen atop the center stack. A tall center console separated the driver and passenger compartments, enhancing cabin comfort and storage options. The rear seats featured three headrests and seat belts, with a split-folding configuration that expanded the trunk space to 560 liters (19.8 cu-ft).</p>
                <p>Powering the X2 were a range of diesel and gasoline engines paired with eight-speed automatic transmissions and mild-hybrid systems for improved fuel efficiency. The top-of-the-line iX35M version boasted a turbocharged two-liter gasoline engine delivering 300 PS (296 hp), while the base model featured a turbocharged inline-three engine producing 170 PS (168 hp).</p>

                <h2>BMW X3 (E83)</h2>
                <h3>2004-2007</h3>
                <p>After the BMW X5 found success, BMW quickly followed up with a smaller version, launching the first generation of the BMW X3 in 2003.</p>
                <p>In fall 2003, at the Frankfurt Auto Show, BMW introduced the smaller sibling of the X5. The X3 had few competitors at the time, notably the Land Rover Freelander, also developed under BMW's guidance. Built on the BMW 3-Series platform, it shared rear suspension with the compact sedan.</p>
                <p>Its design, resembling a station wagon on elevated stilts, was a contentious point, especially its distinctive headlights, which were revised in a 2007 facelift.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X3 comfortably seated five adults with ample headroom and decent rear legroom. The dashboard offered optional iDrive infotainment, controlled via a central rotary knob. Entertainment options included a BMW AM/FM/M-CD Radio with eight speakers, and a panoramic sunroof was available as an option.</p>
                <p>The X3 featured BMW's all-wheel-drive system, developed with Magna Steyr in Austria where the SUV was manufactured. Standard across models, the system provided a default 40:60 torque split between front and rear axles, capable of directing up to 100 percent of engine torque to either axle via an electronically controlled multiple-plate clutch.</p>
                <p>Engine choices included 2.0-liter and 3.0-liter options, with four and six cylinders respectively, delivering varying levels of power and performance.</p>

                <h3>2007-2010</h3>
                <p>BMW launched the X3 in 2003, and in October 2006, it refreshed the model significantly during its mid-life cycle update.</p>
                <p>BMW launched the X5 in 1999, followed by the smaller X3 four years later. These models were categorized as Sports Activity Vehicles (SAVs), designed primarily for paved roads with occasional off-road use, although most were equipped with all-wheel-drive.</p>
                <p>In 2006, the X3 received a mid-cycle update (LCI), which included new headlights and fog lights that created a distinctive "six-eye" appearance at the front. The front and rear bumpers were redesigned with a clear separation between upper and lower sections, and new taillight designs were introduced.</p>
                <p>Inside, upgrades included a new three-spoke steering wheel and galvanized metal door handles, along with improved interior materials and upholstery.</p>
                <p>BMW typically enhances engine options during LCIs, and for the 2006 X3, several engines were revised or replaced. The standard suspension offered a firm damper setting, with an optional sport package for those prioritizing handling over comfort.</p>

                <p>The second-generation BMW X3 debuted at the 2010 Paris Auto Show, showcasing a larger size and a design akin to the X4. It aimed to enhance comfort and space compared to its predecessor, addressing previous concerns about interior roominess and ride quality.</p>
                <p>The redesigned suspension significantly improved ride comfort while maintaining the X3's agile handling reminiscent of the 3-Series sedan. Inside, there was a notable upgrade in fit and finish, emphasizing a sporty yet refined atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Two trim levels were offered: the xDrive 28i and the more powerful xDrive 35i. Standard features included 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing wipers, leatherette upholstery, automatic climate control, cruise control, Bluetooth, BMW's iDrive system, and a 12-speaker sound system.</p>
                <p>The xDrive 35i variant included 18-inch alloys and adaptive xenon headlights.

                <p>In 2003, BMW introduced the first generation of the X3, branding it as an SAV (Sports Activity Vehicle) rather than an SUV. It aimed to blend sportiness with off-road capability.

Inside, new materials and color options refreshed the cabin, which offered a spacious trunk of 550 liters (19.4 cu-ft), expandable to 1600 liters (56.5 cu-ft). The X3 was available in rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive configurations, featuring a variety of engines paired with either a 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission, including a powerful 2.0-liter twin-turbo diesel with 190 hp.</p>

                <h2>BMW X3 (G01)</h2>
                <h3>2017-2021</h3>
                <p>The BMW X3, which pioneered BMW's SAV lineup in 2003, entered its third generation in 2017 with significant advancements in design and technology. Everything from the platform to the engines and interior was completely new. The only component retained was the ZF 8-speed automatic gearbox, albeit with updated software.</p>
                <p>The 2017 BMW X3 received several updates and enhancements. It features a larger grille at the front with additional cooling openings in the bumper. Behind the grille, there's radar for adaptive cruise control and AEBS (Automatic Emergency Braking System). The overall size increased slightly, with a longer wheelbase that benefits rear-seat passengers.</p>
                <p>Inside, a new semi-automated driving system assists the driver by maintaining lane position, following other vehicles at a safe distance, and braking when necessary. However, full autonomous driving isn't allowed, so the driver must keep hands on the wheel intermittently.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the X3 offers a range of engines including a new 2.0-liter gasoline unit with 181 hp as the base engine. The top-tier model is the X3 M Competition with a robust 503 hp engine. Turbodiesel options and a 293 hp plug-in hybrid version are also available.</p>

                <h2>BMW X3 M (F97)</h2>
                <h3>2019-Present</h3>
                <p>In 2019, BMW launched its first M-badged X3 model, providing customers with a high-performance crossover that could rival hot hatches and sports cars in terms of speed and agility.</p>
                <p>BMW responded to customer demands for more power and performance from the X3 by introducing its first-ever M-badged model in 2019. Engineers didn't just enhance the engine; they overhauled the entire vehicle from front to back.</p>
                <p>Outside, the X3 M received a redesigned bumper with a deeper apron and a prominent central air intake flanked by faux side scoops. The grille was blacked out for a more aggressive look. The profile showcased unique front fenders with decorative exhaust vents and aerodynamically-profiled side sills. At the rear, a roof spoiler and quad exhausts emphasized its sporty demeanor.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X3 M featured standard sport seats, a digital instrument cluster, and a free-floating infotainment unit atop the center stack. The center console housed controls for driving modes and the gear selector, while the M-specific steering wheel had additional customizable buttons. The rear provided ample space for three passengers on a split-folding bench seat.</p>
                <p>Underneath, the X3 M boasted a newly-developed S58 twin-turbocharged gasoline engine, delivering swift acceleration with a 0-60 mph time of under four seconds. Paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and equipped with launch control, the vehicle also featured upgraded brakes with four-pot calipers and stiffer suspension for enhanced handling.</p>
                <p>In essence, the X3 M not only fulfilled the desire for increased power but also delivered a comprehensive performance package that elevated the driving experience to new heights within the SUV segment.</p>

                <h2>BMW X3 M (F97)</h2>
                <h3>2021-Present</h3>
                <p>In 2021, BMW refreshed the third-generation X3 lineup, including the high-performance X3 M model.</p>
                <p>The BMW X3 debuted in 2003 as a compact SUV with a design by Chris Bangle that initially divided opinions but won customers over with its overall quality. By its third generation, BMW responded to demand with the introduction of the highly anticipated M version. Initially, it began with the M 4.0i package in 2018, eventually evolving into a full-fledged M variant boasting 480 horsepower.</p>
                <p>In 2017, BMW redesigned the X3, offering an M Competition package that featured a new front fascia with narrower headlights by 10 mm. Optional adaptive LED headlights with MATRIX function were also available. The grille sported a piano-black finish with vertical slats to complement the apron's aesthetics. At the rear, the X3 M Competition showcased new LED taillights with a distinctive design and a diffuser beneath the bumper.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X3 M received a revamped center console housing a new gear selector, iDrive dial, and buttons. Positioned above the center stack was a 12-inch wide-format touchscreen for the infotainment system. The digital instrument panel was significantly updated, now featuring Driving Assistant Professional as standard and integrating with Amazon Alexa via the My BMW app.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW enhanced the X3 M's 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine, incorporating a crankshaft borrowed from the M4. This upgrade increased power output, reducing the 0-62 mph acceleration time to an impressive 3.8 seconds.</p>

                <h3>2014-2018</h3>
                <p>Following the success of the X6 Sports Activity Coupe (SAC), BMW decided to create a smaller, sportier version of the X3.</p>
                <p>BMW popularized the SUV-coupe trend with the X6, prompting other automakers to try and catch up. In 2014, BMW introduced the X4 at the New York International Auto Show. While not the most spacious SUV, it stood out with its unique shape and powerful engines.</p>
                <p>The X4 featured a front fascia similar to the X3, with a distinctive lower apron and a large kidney grille with vertical slats. The sloped roof ended with a small deck behind the rear window. Inside, the X4 had bolstered front seats and a wide center console. The driver’s area included an instrument cluster with analog dials and a display for the onboard computer, and a head-up display was available as an option. The rear had a 40:20:40 split-folding bench seat suitable for three adults.</p>
                <p>The X4 came with various turbocharged gasoline and diesel engines, depending on the market. It typically featured a six-speed manual gearbox, with an eight-speed automatic as an option.</p>

                <p>The 2018 BMW X4 second generation featured a more aggressive and modern front with a larger grille. At the rear, it showcased new taillights similar to those on the BMW 8-Series and 3-Series, positioned at the outer edges. Inside, it offered 525 liters of cargo space, expandable with foldable rear seats and a convenient trunk opening via the BMW logo.</p>
                <p>Enhanced driving dynamics included a double wishbone setup, widened rear track, and 50-50 front-to-rear weight distribution for improved handling. Lowered ride height contributed to a lower center of gravity, facilitating high-speed cornering.</p>
                <p>Engine options ranged from a standard 190 hp model to the top-of-the-line 354 hp M40i. The interior boasted premium materials, a modern virtual digital cockpit, and comfortable, supportive seats. However, rear passengers may find headroom limited due to the low roofline, with the middle seat suitable mainly for a child.</p>

                <p>The 2019 BMW X4M finally gets the prestigious M badge. It's not just a sport-package; it's a genuine M vehicle, evident from its aggressive look and wheels. Contrary to rumors, it doesn't use the inline-six engine from the M3/M4. Instead, it boasts a new straight-six engine, soon to be featured in future M3 and M4 models.</p>
                <p>The new BMW X4 M features BMW's most powerful 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged six-cylinder engine, delivering 480 hp and 600 Nm (442 lb-ft) of torque in the standard model, and 510 hp in the X4 M Competition. Power is transmitted through an 8-speed automatic transmission to all four wheels via the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, which debuted in the 2018 BMW M5. Acceleration is swift, with 0-100 kph (62 mph) achieved in 4.2 seconds for the standard model and 4.1 seconds for the Competition variant.</p>
                <p>The exterior is enhanced with a redesigned front bumper featuring larger air-scoops and an apron, complemented by new optional 20” M light-alloy wheels for added aerodynamics.</p>

                <p>BMW introduced the X4 in 2014 as a smaller sibling to the revolutionary X6.

Both shared BMW's CLAR platform with larger models like the X5 and sedans.</p>
                <p>The facelifted X4 featured a new front bumper design with a single-section kidney grille framed by a mesh pattern. Adaptive Matrix LED headlights were standard, set 10 mm lower than before.

                <p>The E36 marked a significant design shift for the 3 Series, moving from exposed rounded headlights to twin headlamps under a shared glass cover, which divided opinions among fans. Despite this, the car excelled in all areas. It featured a new suspension, larger wheelbase, and more potent engines, establishing itself as a leader among premium compact sedans. The coupe variant introduced frameless windows, adding a touch of sportiness.</p>
                <p>Inside, the driver-oriented dashboard offered intuitive controls and a practical layout.

                <p>The X5 and X6 M were the first BMW all-wheel-drive vehicles to wear the prestigious M logo. Prior to this, BMW had offered powerful versions with engines like the 4.4-liter and 4.6-liter, but they weren't deemed worthy of the iconic light-blue, navy-blue, and red badge until the second generation of the X5 in 2009.</p>
                <p>To distinguish the X5 M, BMW's motorsport division designed new front bumpers with larger air dams and flanking air scoops. M-specific badges adorned the front fenders, while 20-inch light-alloy wheels highlighted its performance from the side profile. At the rear, quad exhausts reinforced its sporty credentials.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X5 M featured a leather interior with M badges on the steering wheel, gear selector, and tachometer. Power-adjustable sport bucket seats with adjustable bolsters provided excellent side support. Piano-black trims adorned the center console, door cards, and dashboard, complemented by aluminum paddle-shifters behind the steering wheel. Rear passengers enjoyed a spacious split-folding bench.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW's motorsport team fitted a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine paired with a six-speed automatic transmission sending power to all wheels. Braking was handled by four-pot calipers up front and single-pot in the rear, while adaptive dampers enhanced the all-wheel independent suspension.</p>

                <p>While engineers rushed to update X5 engines for Euro 5 emissions, the design changes in the 2010 model (E70) were subtle.

                <p>Inside, the 2010 X5 looked mostly unchanged except for an upgraded iDrive system, which offered more intuitive menus. Optionally, a third row of jump seats could be added in the trunk area.</p>

This boosted the output to 575 hp and 750 Nm (553 lb-ft) of torque. Power was transmitted through a newly developed 8-speed Steptronic automatic gearbox.</p>
                <p>On the outside, the BMW X5 M received a new aerodynamic package with large front air intakes, model-specific side gills, M exterior mirrors, and a quad-tailpipe exhaust system that instantly identifies it as an M model. It also features M-specific 20-inch light-alloy wheels with optional 21-inch forged M light-alloy wheels.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X5 M boasts a high-performance SUV interior designed for intuitive usability. M GmbH adds its distinctive touches, including a newly developed M leather steering wheel with gearshift paddles, a unique M gearshift lever, and an instrument cluster with an M Drive menu. The optional Head-Up Display and multifunction switch with M Drive buttons on the steering wheel further enhance the M experience.</p>

                <h3>2014-2018</h3>
                <p>In 2014, BMW introduced the third generation of its revolutionary SUV, aiming to maintain its segment-leading sales position by staying ahead of the competition.</p>
                <p>In 2014, BMW revolutionized the SUV market by introducing the third generation of the X5, which departed from traditional 4x4 vehicles. Unlike its competitors, BMW's SUV featured unibody construction and no transfer case or low-gear options, a departure from the chassis-based designs of its rivals, like the first-generation ML by Mercedes-Benz.</p>
                <p>The 2014 X5 retained BMW's iconic design with a larger kidney grille that spanned from headlight to headlight. It offered optional Adaptive LED headlights and standard xenon headlights for higher trims like the X5 5.0i and X5 M50d.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X5 provided a spacious cabin with comfortable seating for five. The centerpiece was a 10.25” color display for the infotainment system, controlled via BMW's iDrive rotary knob on the center console. Some versions offered a touchpad atop the knob for easier input, such as typing addresses into the navigation system.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the X5 lineup included a range of engines, starting from a small 2.0-liter option with rear-wheel-drive, a first for the model. The top-tier models boasted over 400 hp and ample torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission. Additionally, BMW introduced a plug-in hybrid variant for the environmentally conscious.</p>

                <p>In 2018, BMW launched the fourth generation of the X5, a model that had already achieved significant maturity with over 2.2 million units sold across its three previous generations.</p>
                <p>The 2018 BMW X5, a top contender in the premium SUV segment, received significant enhancements to maintain its leading position. The bold grille divided opinions, while slimmer headlights aligned with BMW's modern design language. LED headlights were standard, with optional BMW Laserlight. Base models rode on 18” alloy wheels, and the rear retained its split tailgate with power operation.</p>
                <p>Inside, the spacious cabin comfortably accommodated five adults with a versatile 40:20:40 split rear bench. Rear passengers enjoyed numerous USB ports and 12V outlets, with optional dual 10.2” touch-screen displays for entertainment. The driver faced a digital instrument cluster and a central infotainment screen controlled via voice, gestures, steering wheel buttons, or the iDrive rotary knob.</p>
                <p>Engine options included a 2.0-liter turbocharged diesel and a 4.4-liter V8 turbo gasoline unit, although availability varied by region. All variants featured an 8-speed automatic transmission, with higher-performance models offering 3.0-liter diesel engines and an M version for enthusiasts.</p>

                <h3>2019-2023</h3>
                <p>The X5 M, the pinnacle of the X5 lineup, offered significantly more power and torque than its predecessor. For enthusiasts craving even more, BMW provided an upgraded version.</p>
                <p>When BMW launched the first X5 in 1999, it quickly became a sales success. Its unit-body construction made it lighter than competitors like the Mercedes-Benz ML, which used a body-on-frame design. Fast forward to the present day, and the X5 M delivers more power than three of those first-generation X5s combined.</p>
                <p>The 2019 X5 M featured a distinct front bumper compared to the rest of the X5 lineup, showcasing a wider lower grille and functional side scoops. Inside, the leather-clad interior offered high-bolstered seats at the front and a spacious rear bench with a versatile 40/20/40 split-fold system, expanding cargo capacity from 650 liters to a maximum of 1,870 liters. The dashboard included a large 12.3-inch infotainment display and, new for 2019, a digital instrument panel.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW M equipped the X5 M with an enhanced 4.4-liter twin-turbo engine. While the previous model delivered 575 hp, the 2019 version boosted this to 600 hp in the regular M and 625 hp in the Competition Package variant.</p>

                <h3>2008-2009</h3>
                <p>In 2008, BMW introduced the X6, a distinctive coupe-shaped SUV that divided opinions among customers due to its unique design.</p>
                <p>BMW introduced the first generation of the X6 in 2008, based on the same platform as the second-generation X5 (E70). It was marketed as a Sport Activity Coupe (SAC), distinguishing it from traditional SUVs. Despite launching just before the global financial crisis, the X6 carved its niche and thrived.</p>
                <p>Visually imposing, the X6 featured distinct organic-shaped headlights flanking a narrow grille. It offered a choice between a standard bumper with a rectangular lower grille or an M-Package option with a trapezoidal air intake and oversized fog lamp scoops. The coupe-like roofline gave it a sporty appearance, though its tall stance differed from typical coupes. At the rear, extended taillights flowed from the sloped tailgate's vertical metallic panel, while a robust bumper concealed dual or quad exhausts.</p>
                <p>Inside, the X6 accommodated four passengers in high-bolstered bucket seats. The driver faced a mixed instrument panel with large speedometer and tachometer dials, flanked by gauges for fuel level and engine temperature, and supported by an LCD for additional data. The iDrive infotainment system was centrally located atop the console, controlled via a rotary knob.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, a range of turbocharged diesel and gasoline engines, including inline-six and V8 options, was available. These were paired with six-speed automatic transmissions and all-wheel-drive as standard. The system dynamically distributed torque to optimize traction, displayed on an LCD dash readout.</p>

                <p>Sure, it had its drawbacks, like limited cargo space and seating for just four. But for driving enthusiasts, the X6M was a standout choice.</p>
                <p>Developed by BMW’s Motorsport division, it boasted a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V8 engine churning out 555 hp—5 hp more than the Cayenne Turbo S.</p>
                <p>Handling more like a sports sedan, it rode on 20-inch alloys with a special sport-tuned adaptive suspension.</p>
                <p>Standard features included xenon headlamps, leather upholstery, dual-zone automatic climate control, Bluetooth, and a navigation system with real-time traffic. Optional upgrades included ventilated seats, a rearview camera, and a premium sound system.</p>
                <p>Despite its weight, it sprinted to 100 km/h in just 4.8 seconds—a remarkable feat for a vehicle weighing 2,500 kg.</p>
                <p>For safety, it included ABS, stability control, multiple airbags, and whiplash-reducing front head restraints.</p>

                <p>BMW made several improvements to the X6 in 2010, despite facing lower-than-expected sales due to the global financial crisis. Introduced in 2008 as a Sports Activity Coupe based on the X5 platform, the 2010 model-year saw visual updates like redesigned headlights and a new hood with a power dome for Active Hybrid and M-powered versions.</p>
                <p>Inside, BMW addressed customer feedback by redesigning the rear bench seat to accommodate three passengers instead of just four, though trunk space remained limited compared to other SUVs.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW enhanced the engine lineup. European markets received a twin-turbocharged diesel option like the 4.0d, boosting power. The base model also saw a power increase. Additionally, BMW introduced the Active Hybrid version, offering improved fuel efficiency compared to the 50i version, though it fell short of competitors in this aspect.</p>

                <p>Most of the X6 M's body remained the same, but with distinctive touches. The front bumper featured a larger grille and functional side scoops, while vents behind the front wheel arches aided air extraction. Unlike adding a roof spoiler, BMW opted for a small lip on the sloped tailgate to keep the taillights clean at high speeds.</p>
                <p>Inside, BMW offered a spacious cabin for five adults with high-bolstered front seats and various trim options. The instrument cluster included BMW's classic four-dial display with an onboard computer screen. The iDrive infotainment system atop the center stack was controlled via a rotary knob and buttons. The sloped roofline affected rear headroom.</p>

                <p>After weathering the financial crisis, BMW saw a secure future for its Sport Activity Coupe (SAC). So, they launched the second generation of the X6 in late 2014, learning from past customer feedback. This time, they got it right.</p>
                <p>The X6's unique design sparked controversy—some loved its aggressive front with sleek headlights and a less imposing grille. The sloping roofline divided opinions, aiming to make the SUV look sportier. Wide rear fenders added to its muscular appearance, accentuated by new LED taillights.</p>
                <p>Inside, BMW abandoned the previous four-seat standard, now offering room for five. Front seats were bolstered for stability during fast turns.

A center console housed the iDrive controller and gear selector, while the driver-oriented layout included advanced safety controls.</p>
                <p>Engine options included a range of six and eight-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines, with highlights like the powerful M50d diesel boasting four turbochargers and 375 horsepower. All models came with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive as standard.</p>

                <h2>BMW X7 (G07)</h2>
                <h3>2018-2022</h3>
                <p>BMW made its entry into the 7-seat SUV market with the 2018 X7, competing directly with the Mercedes-Benz GLS and Audi Q7.</p>
                <p>When BMW launched its first X5 in 1999, it was an instant hit, prompting the automaker to build a factory for it in the U.S. Derived from Land Rover technology, the X5's sales soared thanks to its lightweight unibody construction, unlike the Mercedes-Benz ML's body-on-frame design. The X7, a larger version of the X5, followed suit.</p>
                <p>The X7's distinctive front end featured a controversially large grille with vertical slats that aided engine cooling. The spacious cabin took cues from the 7-Series, offering luxurious leather upholstery across all seven seats. A panoramic glass roof option enhanced the interior's brightness and openness. The car boasted BMW Live Cockpit Professional with dual 12.3” digital displays as standard.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the X7 offered two gasoline engines and a 3.0-liter diesel, including a variant with four turbochargers. All engines were paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>

                <p>BMW refreshed its flagship SUV, the X7, with a facelift in 2022, updating its appearance and powertrains.</p>
                <p>BMW redesigned its flagship SUV, the X7, aiming for premium appeal and competing directly with Mercedes-Benz GLS and Cadillac Escalade in the seven-seat luxury SUV market. Unlike traditional body-on-frame competitors like the Cadillac, the X7 retained a lighter unibody construction similar to the Mercedes-Benz GLS.</p>
                <p>The X7's design language echoed the BMW 7 Series, featuring a contentious oversized kidney grille that divided opinions among fans. Full-LED headlights were integrated into the upper bumper, accompanied by distinctive daytime running lights positioned above, resembling eyebrows.</p>
                <p>Inside, BMW enhanced acoustic comfort with new materials and improved insulation. The cabin offered options for a six-seat configuration, including two captain's chairs in the middle row, providing spacious comfort for rear passengers.</p>
                <p>Powering the 2022 X7 were all-wheel-drive systems paired with either an inline-six turbodiesel or a potent V8 engine. Both engine options utilized an eight-speed automatic transmission equipped with mild-hybrid technology for enhanced efficiency and performance.</p>

                <h2>BMW XM</h2>
                <h3>2022-Present</h3>
                <p>BMW launched the XM in 2023, marking its entry into the full-size luxurious and sporty SUV segment. It stands as the most powerful production model ever made by the German automaker.</p>
                <p>BMW's XM, introduced in 2023, represents a departure from traditional M models by focusing on performance SUVs. Unlike its predecessors, the XM was designed from scratch to compete in the high-performance SUV segment.</p>
                <p>Externally, the XM resembles the iX lineup with its distinctive design. The front grille is wider and shorter, featuring angular shapes rather than the typical tall and narrow kidney grille. The SUV's profile is accentuated by large 21" wheels and angular wheel arches, along with chrome trim around the windows. At the rear, four hexagonal exhausts are stacked two-by-two on each side.</p>
                <p>Inside, the XM offers a luxurious interior with sporty front bucket seats. A wide, curved glass panel spans the dashboard, housing both the driver's dials and the iDrive infotainment screen. Angular shapes seen on the exterior are mirrored in the interior design, especially in the vents and headliner.</p>
                <p>Powering the XM is a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 engine paired with a 197 hp electric motor integrated into the eight-speed automatic transmission. This setup delivers a massive combined torque of 590 lb-ft (800 Nm), distributed to all corners. The SUV also features a 29.5 kWh battery pack, providing an electric range of up to 82 km (51 miles) with zero emissions.</p>

                <p>BMW arrived late to the electric SUV scene but didn't disappoint. They brought a vehicle that could not only match but also surpass most of its competitors.</p>
                <p>When Tesla shook the automotive industry with the Roadster, few foresaw the coming revolution. As interest in electric cars grew, major carmakers began developing new products. BMW's first effort was the i3, heralding its electric brand, BMW-i. In 2020, BMW introduced its next product, the iX.</p>
                <p>The iX featured a controversial design with a massive, mostly aesthetic grille and narrow LED headlights, giving it a futuristic, Transformers-like appearance. Its shape resembled other BMW X models.</p>
                <p>Inside, the iX boasted a futuristic, sloped dashboard with a single, curved display combining a 12.3-inch Information Display and a 14.9-inch Control Display. The front seats had integrated headrests, and the rear featured a 40:20:40 split-folding bench for increased trunk space.</p>
                <p>The iX was powered by 500 hp electric motors and had a battery pack providing a range of 600 km (372 miles).</p>

                <p>BMW refined its approach to electric vehicles with the iX1, introduced in 2022. Sharing many components with its gasoline, diesel, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid counterparts, the iX1 was designed to optimize development costs.</p>

                <p>The iX M60 marks a new era for BMW M as its first purely electric vehicle designed and engineered from the ground up.</p>
                <p>The M department, established half a century ago, initially improved regular BMW cars and later focused on enhancing the performance of crossovers, known as SAVs (Sport Activity Vehicles). The X5 was the first to receive such treatment. The iX M60, unveiled in early 2022, marked a significant evolution, offering the highest torque for any M-powered vehicle.</p>
                <p>The iX M60 features a controversial front fascia with a vertical kidney grille. Its dimensions are similar to the X5 in length and the X7 in width, but it is lower in height with a roofline resembling the X6. Despite its size, it is light due to the extensive use of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic).</p>
                <p>Inside, the lack of a transmission tunnel creates more legroom and storage space. The seats are multicontour for comfort and support during high-speed cornering. It features the BMW Operating System 8 with a wide, curved display integrating the instrument cluster and infotainment unit.</p>
