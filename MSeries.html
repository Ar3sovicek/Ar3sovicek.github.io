            <h2>M1</h2>
            <p>The BMW M1, launched in 1978, is a famous sports car and the first from BMW's M division. Designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, it has a distinctive wedge shape and mid-engine layout. Its 3.5-liter inline-six engine produces 273 horsepower. Initially meant for racing, street versions were made due to homologation rules. The M1 is rare, iconic, and highly valued in BMW's history.</p>

                <h2>BMW M1 (E26)</h2>
                <h3>1978-1981</h3>
                <p>Founded in 1972, BMW M initially focused on developing and building race cars. By 1978, all their models were based on existing BMWs. However, the BMW M1 was a game-changer as it was the first built entirely from scratch. Its chassis was crafted at Marchesi, bodywork at T.I.R in Italy, and the interior was assembled by ItalDesign.</p>
                <p>BMW, unable to meet the production demands of 400 street-legal units alone, partnered with Lamborghini for the M1, also known as the E26. The mechanical assembly took place in Stuttgart.</p>
                <p>The M1 featured a coupe body style and marked BMW's first use of a center-mounted 3.5-liter 6-cylinder engine, generating 277 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. This layout allowed for further racing modifications. The next BMW with a center-mounted engine would be the modern i8.</p>
                <p>Production of the M1 was limited to just 453 units over three years from 1978 to 1981. It remains one of BMW's rarest and most successful race cars.</p>
                <p>In 2008, BMW celebrated the M1's 30th anniversary with the M1 Hommage Concept, sparking discussions about a potential modern M1 model.</p>

                <h3>2015-2018</h3>
                <p>The BMW M2 is a small, powerful coupe introduced in 2016. It's known for its strong engine, sharp handling, and sporty design. With rear-wheel drive and a choice of manual or automatic transmission, it offers a thrilling driving experience tailored for enthusiasts.</p>
                <p>The BMW M2 debuted at the Mazda Laguna Seca Raceway, showcasing its superior performance. Setting it apart from other 2 Series models were its distinctive bumper with larger air intakes and flared wheel arches, signaling its higher horsepower. A rear spoiler and quad-exhaust system further emphasized its enhanced capabilities.</p>
                <p>For a track-focused experience, the M2 offered an optional M-DCT gearbox and utilized brakes sourced from the M3/M4. Under the hood, it featured a twin-scroll turbocharger instead of the M3/M4's twin-turbo setup, resulting in slightly less horsepower but still impressive acceleration from 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph). Despite not having components like a carbon-fiber driveshaft found in its larger siblings, the M2 was priced more affordably.</p>
                <p>Equipped with adaptive suspension, the M2 provided both comfort on the road and agility. Its wider front and rear tracks, facilitated by an aluminum suspension, contributed to enhanced stability compared to the standard 2 Series.</p>

                <h2>BMW M2 Competition</h2>
                <h3>2018-Present</h3>
                <p>The M2 was a serious sports car that sparked debates about whether it could outperform the larger M4 on the track. When BMW introduced the Competition version, the question became even more challenging to answer.</p>
                <p>BMW has a rich history with sport-compact sedans, starting with the iconic BMW M3 in the '80s. This lineage continued with a full range of M-Power vehicles, where the M2 stood out as the smallest yet potent model.</p>
                <p>The M2 Competition featured a redesigned bumper with specific air intakes for engine and brake cooling. Its enlarged black BMW kidney grilles and black side vents on the front fenders added to its aggressive appearance. At the rear, the four black exhausts distinguished it from other M Competition models, complementing its exclusive Hockenheim Silver color option.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M2 Competition catered to track enthusiasts with sport-bucket seats and distinctive M2 Competition badges on the seats and door sills. The instrument cluster showcased a black background with red needles and white lettering.</p>
                <p>Technically, the M2 Competition boasted a 3.0-liter twin-turbo engine producing 410 hp. It came standard with a 6-speed manual gearbox, with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic available as an option. An electronically controlled rear differential ensured optimal traction, enhancing its performance credentials.</p>

                <h3>2019-2023</h3>
                <p>In 2019, BMW launched the M2 CS, aimed at enhancing the M2's track performance by borrowing technologies from its larger siblings, the M3 and M4, including their engine.</p>
                <p>The M2 CS took BMW's acclaimed M2 to a higher level of performance and everyday usability. It retained its mean appearance while gaining more power and improved underpinnings, making it a favorite among enthusiasts worldwide. Unlike many sports cars focused solely on track performance, BMW designed the M2 CS to excel both on the road and on the circuit. Notably, it offered a three-pedal setup, a rarity in modern sports cars.</p>
                <p>Externally, the M2 CS featured an aggressive front fascia with enlarged kidney grilles and additional cooling vents beneath the bumper. A distinctive hood vent aided in heat extraction, complemented by a carbon fiber lip and vents on the front fenders and side skirts. At the rear, a carbon fiber spoiler and a diffuser housing four exhaust pipes completed the sporty look.</p>
                <p>Inside, drivers enjoyed an Alcantara-covered steering wheel and trim across the dashboard, center console, and door panels. The high-bolstered sports seats offered comfort and support, with rear seating available for short journeys. The analog instrument cluster included large dials for speed and RPM, while the iDrive infotainment screen sat atop the center stack.</p>
                <p>Underneath, the M2 CS shared its S55 inline-six engine with the M3 and M4, providing ample power for both spirited driving and daily commutes. The choice of a six-speed manual or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox ensured versatility in various driving conditions.</p>

                <p>BMW surprised many by introducing the second generation of the M2 in fall 2022.</p>
                <p>The 2022 M2 continued its tradition by packing an M3/M4 engine into the smaller 2-Series body. It gained 90 more horsepower compared to the 2015 model but also became heavier. BMW made significant exterior changes, including a blacked-out grille, angular front bumper with squared scoops, and muscular flared fenders. At the rear, it featured a squared lower bumper and a duck-tail trunk reminiscent of the E46 M3 CSL.</p>
                <p>Inside, the dashboard resembled the 2-Series Coupe but with dual screens and a separate instrument panel. Sport bucket seats added to the performance-oriented interior feel. Under the hood, it shared the turbocharged straight-six engine with the M3/M4, though with less power, and came with a choice of a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic gearbox.</p>

                <p>In April 2023, BMW launched the second generation of the M2. By summer 2024, they revealed an upgraded version that offered a three-pedal setup as an option.</p>
                <p>BMW surprised enthusiasts by introducing the updated 2025 M2 just a year after its initial launch. Despite expectations for an M2 CS or Competition variant, BMW opted for subtle yet significant upgrades. The front end featured angular air intakes and a kidney grille with a larger M2 badge. LED headlights were standard, with integrated daytime running lights doubling as turn signals. On the sides, the M2 maintained its sleek profile with flared fenders and aerodynamic side sills, sitting on unique 19-inch front and 20-inch rear wheels. At the rear, quad exhausts with black tips were standard.</p>
                <p>Inside, BMW offered customizable options like a flat-bottom steering wheel with M-function buttons, available in leather or Alcantara. Carbon-fiber sports seats were available, enhancing the sporty feel. Under the hood, the 2025 M2 boasted the more powerful S58 turbocharged engine, accelerating faster than before. Standard was an eight-speed automatic transmission, with a six-speed manual available for purists. Adaptive dampers and adjustable brake-pedal feedback further enhanced the driving experience.</p>

                <h2>BMW M3 Coupe (E30)</h2>
                <h3>1986-1992</h3>
                <p>The BMW M3 E30 was the first-ever M3 and a dominant force in touring car racing, claiming over 1500 victories in its class. Since its debut in 1986, the series model quickly became an icon in motorsports.</p>
                <p>The BMW E30 M3 was initially built as a race car to meet touring championship regulations, which required at least 5000 units produced annually and shared parts with the race model. BMW adapted the race car for the road despite sales department concerns.</p>
                <p>Based on the E30 coupe, the M3 featured distinct C-pillars and a shorter trunk. It had widened front and rear fenders to house new suspension and a broader track. Two evolutions were produced, with one offering adjustable aerodynamics like a front apron extension and rear wing angle.</p>
                <p>Inside, it boasted sport-bucket seats and comfort amenities like leather upholstery, an onboard computer, air conditioning, and a manual gearbox. Under the hood was a newly developed 2.3-liter inline-four engine with twin-cam and 16 valves, producing nearly 200 hp. It offered two 5-speed manual options, including a dog-leg variant with different gear ratios.</p>

                <h2>BMW M3 Coupe (E36)</h2>
                <h3>1992-1998</h3>
                <p>The 1992 BMW M3 was the first to feature a six-cylinder engine. Unlike the iconic E30 M3, it was offered as a coupe, sedan, and convertible.</p>
                <p>The BMW E36 M3 was conceived due to the success of the E30 M3 and the positive reception of the M5. Unlike its predecessor, it featured a more subtle design without flared arches or a prominent rear wing. Instead, it had distinctive bumpers, aerodynamic sills, and unique rear-view mirrors.</p>
                <p>Inside, the E36 M3 boasted sport-bucket seats and special upholstery, along with M-badging on the instrument cluster and seats.</p>
                <p>In Europe, it offered 286 hp from a 3.0-liter engine, while U.S. versions were detuned to 240 hp due to different fuel regulations. Later, from 1995 onwards, the engine was enlarged to 3.2 liters, producing 321 hp in Europe and maintaining 240 hp in the U.S., albeit with increased torque. Initially paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, post-1995 models received a 6-speed manual, with an optional SMG automated gearbox available for both variants.</p>

                <p>BMW launched the second generation of the M3 in 1992, but it wasn't until two years later, in 1994, that they unveiled the convertible version of the car.</p>
                <p>BMW introduced the third generation of the 3 Series in 1990, but fans had to wait until 1992 for the M3 version. Unlike its predecessor with an inline-four engine, the E36 M3 featured a powerful inline-six. The convertible version arrived in 1994, sporting a similar front design as the M3 Coupe, including a lower air-dam with a center intake and rectangular fog lights. Its aerodynamic package enhanced with sculpted side skirts aimed to reduce drag. At the rear, a black diffuser and dual exhausts added to its sporty appeal, though more subtly than the E30 M3 Convertible.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M3 Convertible boasted high-bolstered bucket seats upfront and a curved dashboard hosting an instrument cluster akin to lower-spec 3 Series models. The rear bench accommodated two passengers with individual headrests.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, a potent 3.2-liter inline-six engine was paired with a five-speed manual transmission initially. Later, starting with the 1995 model year, BMW introduced significant facelifts and modifications to the E36 lineup.</p>

                <p>The second generation of the BMW M3, unlike its predecessor which was only available as a coupe, offered a sedan and convertible option as well. It maintained a more subtle appearance compared to regular models, though distinct details set it apart.

At the rear, it sported a diffuser and trunk-mounted wing.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M3 sedan boasted a three-spoke steering wheel with an M-badge, high-bolstered bucket seats with optional leather, and standard features like a high-fidelity sound system and onboard computer. Under the hood, it initially housed a 3.0-liter inline-six engine with 286 PS for Europe and 240 horsepower for the U.S., later upgraded in 1995 to a 3.2-liter engine delivering 321 PS in Europe and the same 240 horsepower in the U.S.</p>

                <p>BMW launched the third generation of the M3 in 2000, based on the E46 platform, showing that the automaker had learned from past experiences and was continuing this popular version of the 3 Series.</p>
                <p>After the successful E30 M3, BMW made significant strides with the E36 generation by introducing inline-six engines. However, it was with the E46 M3 that the model truly evolved. Featuring the renowned S54 inline-six engine, it set new standards in performance.</p>
                <p>Unlike its predecessor, the E46 M3 Coupe stood out with a more aggressive front bumper sporting a distinctive V-shaped lower grille and cooling scoops for the brakes. It also included vents on the fenders reminiscent of BMW's historic 507 lineup. The car's profile was enhanced by flared wheel arches and aerodynamically shaped side sills, while the rear boasted quad exhausts and a trunk lip spoiler.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M badge was proudly displayed on the steering wheel, instrument cluster tachometer, and manual transmission gear stick. Standard were high-bolstered bucket seats, with sports seats available as an option. The cabin could also be equipped with a satellite navigation system mounted on the center stack.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the E46 M3 housed an exceptional naturally-aspirated inline-six engine delivering over 100 horsepower per liter. It offered a choice between a six-speed manual transmission or BMW's unique SMG (Sequential Manual Gearbox), providing enthusiasts with top-tier performance and driving dynamics.</p>

                <p>The third generation M3 was available as both a coupe and a convertible. Despite the convertible being heavier than the coupe, it still delivered impressive performance.</p>
                <p>The first generation BMW M3 was initially a racing-oriented car adapted for street use to meet FIA approval. Its unexpected commercial success led BMW to continue offering M3 versions for subsequent 3-Series models. The 2001 M3 (E46) marked the third generation. While over 17,000 units of the E30 M3 were produced, the E46 M3 convertible alone sold nearly 30,000 units.</p>
                <p>The car's aggressive appearance was characterized by its distinctive "Angel Eyes" rounded parking lights and a large bumper with a lower apron to accommodate radiators and coolers. Hood scoops helped release hot air from the engine bay, and modern vents on the front fenders echoed the design of the historic BMW 507. The A-pillar was reinforced for structural integrity, but no other visible reinforcements were added above the body.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M3 Convertible provided seating for four with front bucket seats as standard. Rear space was limited for longer journeys. The soft-top could fully retract behind the rear bench, and the dashboard and center console mirrored those of the coupe version.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the M3 Cabriolet featured the same 3.2-liter S54 engine paired with a standard 6-speed manual transmission. An optional 6-speed automated gearbox called SMGII with a single-clutch system was also available.</p>

                <p>The BMW M3 CSL, named after its “Coupe Sport Leichtbau” characteristics, was meticulously crafted to shed weight and enhance performance. Only produced for a year with just 1383 units, its exterior featured subtle changes like a larger front bumper and a distinctive rear spoiler. Special wheels and small “CSL” badges further distinguished it.</p>
                <p>Inside, the focus was on weight reduction with race-style bucket seats replacing heavier ones. Even the rear bench was made lighter and could be easily removed for racing purposes. Under the hood, its 3.2-liter straight-six engine was tuned for more power than the standard M3, paired with a SMG II gearbox and a limited-slip differential. Overall, the CSL model was 110 kg (243 lbs) lighter, enhancing its agility and driving dynamics significantly.</p>

                <h3>2007-2011</h3>
                <p>The final naturally aspirated BMW M3 debuted in 2007 with a larger V8 engine. Surprisingly, this new engine was lighter than its predecessor, the six-cylinder it replaced. This change improved sound quality, increased power output, and enhanced handling characteristics.</p>
                <p>The E92 BMW M3, launched in 2007, stood out with its distinctive hood bump, fender vents, and lowered suspension, setting it apart from other E92 models. Built to excel as a grand tourer, sports car, and track performer, it featured a potent eight-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed manual transmission. Purists initially had mixed feelings, longing for the original E30 M3 from 1986, which had a smaller, naturally aspirated six-cylinder engine.</p>
                <p>Compared to its predecessor, the E46 M3, the E92 was heavier due to its larger engine but compensated with increased torque at lower revs. Inside, the focus was on combining comfort with driving pleasure, featuring stylish leather sport-bucket seats and BMW's classic instrument cluster. An infotainment display and iDrive controller were positioned high on the dashboard, while rear passengers enjoyed decent space.</p>
                <p>Technological advancements like new suspension, a standard limited-slip differential, and advanced electronics enabled the E92 M3 to deliver superior speed, cornering ability, and drifting performance compared to its predecessor.</p>

                <p>The 2007 BMW M3 marked the end of naturally aspirated M3 models and the debut of a V8 engine, except for the rare 2001 BMW M3 GTR edition.</p>
                <p>The fourth-generation BMW M3 was offered in sedan, coupe, and convertible versions, known internally as the E93. The convertible featured a retractable hard-top that added weight but enhanced driving enjoyment.</p>
                <p>Distinctive features included a unique bumper with large air intakes and a hood bulge accommodating the tall 4.0-liter V8 engine. Functional air vents on the hood and sides cooled the engine and brakes, while four exhausts and a rear diffuser adorned the back. The three-piece hard-top retracted in 22 seconds.</p>
                <p>Inside, it offered typical convertible space with improved rear legroom due to a longer wheelbase, though seating was limited to two.</p>
                <p>Power came from a 4.0-liter naturally aspirated V8 paired with a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automated gearbox, the latter offering quicker gear changes for faster acceleration.</p>

                <p>The 2007 introduction of the fourth-generation BMW M3, which included the third iteration of the four-door model, set a new benchmark in the sport-sedan market, becoming the car to beat.</p>
                <p>The M3 story began in the '80s with a street car modified for FIA approval, starting with the successful E30 M3 available only as a two-door. The next E36 M3 added a four-door variant, which continued in later models alongside coupe and convertible options.</p>
                <p>The M3 sedan stood out with a distinct front bumper featuring a larger grille and side air-dams, plus a hood bulge for the larger engine. Side mirrors were new, and the rear boasted four centered exhausts under the bumper.</p>
                <p>Inside, Motorsport GmbH colors adorned the upholstery, steering wheel, and instrument cluster, with the M3 logo prominent. Front bucket seats provided exceptional cornering grip.</p>
                <p>Underneath, a 4.0-liter V8 engine powered the front wheels through a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox, the latter making the car slightly quicker to 100 kph (62 mph). Its balanced weight distribution ensured impressive cornering speeds.</p>

                <p>In 2010, BMW unveiled the ultimate M3 coupe, featuring the largest engine ever installed in a 3-Series by the German automaker.</p>
                <p>The M3 GTS, famously featured in the "Need for Speed" games, was originally a track-focused coupe made-to-order by BMW. Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the E30 M3, it offered an option to be modified for road use. Based on the standard M3 body, it featured a new front bumper with a carbon-fiber splitter and functional grilles, while the hood had a power-dome and vents. Unique aerodynamic side-sills and a large adjustable rear wing enhanced its profile. Inside, it was stripped-down with lighter components, optional climate control, and no rear seats, but with a roll-cage for rigidity.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, a tuned 4.4-liter V8 engine paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox delivered power to the rear wheels. The suspension was fully adjustable, complemented by a new brake system with vented and drilled discs for improved performance.</p>

                <p>After four generations of the M3 in different body styles, BMW's fifth-generation performance model was exclusively offered as a four-door sedan.</p>
                <p>BMW decided to name its coupe versions with even numbers, so the 3-Series coupe became the 4-Series. However, the iconic M3 badge continued to grace the four-door BMW 3-Series.</p>
                <p>In 2014, BMW introduced the M3, the sportiest variant of the 3-Series. Externally, it distinguished itself with a new front bumper featuring a larger spoiler and wider side air-intakes. Air-vents on the front fenders improved aerodynamics and reduced turbulence around the wheels. Unlike its predecessor, which had a hood bulge for a V8 engine, the M3's bulge was smaller for design and pedestrian safety. Unique 18-inch light-alloy wheels were fitted, and at the rear, a quad-exhaust system was integrated into a bespoke M3 diffuser.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M3 showcased its motorsport heritage with high-bolstered seats, a special steering wheel, an exclusive instrument cluster, and M badge accents throughout the cabin.</p>
                <p>The 2014 M3, known as the F80 model, marked a significant shift as the first turbocharged BMW M3. Its 3.0-liter inline-six engine offered more power and torque than the previous 4.0-liter V8 in the E92 M3. It came standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, with an optional 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox available.</p>

                <p>Nearly three decades after the E30 M3 Evolution, BMW released a special version of the F80 M3: the M3 CS.</p>
                <p>BMW has a history of making light, agile M3s, starting with the 1988 M3 Evolution. In 2017, they introduced the M3 CS, a lighter and more powerful version with better weight distribution and a higher speed limiter of 174 mph (280 kph).</p>
                <p>The M3 CS featured a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) hood and roof, reducing weight by 10 kg (22 lbs). It also had a unique carbon-fiber rear spoiler, a three-section front air intake, 19" front wheels, and 22" rear rims. The rear bumper had a diffuser and four exhaust pipes.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M3 CS combined sportiness with luxury, offering two-tone leather upholstery with Alcantara accents, an advanced infotainment unit, and a Harman Kardon sound system.</p>
                <p>With a lowered, stiffened suspension and a 460 hp engine, the M3 CS was faster than the regular M3. It sent power to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, making it 0.4 seconds quicker than the standard model.</p>

                <p>The BMW M3 is one of the brand's most iconic models, starting the "M-madness" in the mid-'80s and continuing ever since.</p>
                <p>After BMW split its 3-Series into the 4-Series for coupes and the 3-Series for sedans and station wagons, rumors of the M3's retirement spread. However, the M3 continued to improve.</p>
                <p>The seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series debuted in 2018, but M3 fans waited until 2020 for the top-spec version. The 2020 M3 featured a redesigned, more aggressive front bumper, a muscular stance, flared arches, and standard 18” light-alloy wheels. The rear had four exhausts, with an optional performance package that grouped the pipes in the middle.</p>
                <p>Inside, it came standard with sport-bucket seats, a TFT color display instrument cluster, and an infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android support. Models with automatic gearboxes included paddle shifters.</p>
                <p>Notably, the 2020 M3 introduced an all-wheel-drive system for the first time. The standard six-speed manual sent power to the rear wheels, while the xDrive version, available only with the 8-speed automatic, powered all four wheels.</p>

                <p>This limited edition featured a special "Green Goblin" color and black accents on the hood, front bumper, side sills, and roof, indicating carbon-fiber elements. The trunk lid had a carbon-fiber lip spoiler.</p>
                <p>Inside, more carbon-fiber trims were added to the center console, dashboard, and steering wheel. BMW replaced the regular seats with carbon-fiber high-back sports seats in fabric and leather. The dual-screen setup was retained for essential driving information and infotainment use.</p>
                <p>The engine received an additional 40 horsepower, and while the all-wheel-drive setup was standard, removing the speed limiter allowed speeds up to 302 kph (188 mph).</p>

                <p>BMW introduced the first station wagon version of its top-performing M3 at the 2022 Goodwood Festival of Speed, catering to drivers seeking speed despite having growing families.</p>
                <p>BMW first attempted to sell an M-badged station wagon with the M5 Touring in 1992, which saw limited success.</p>
                <p>The M3 Touring, introduced in 2022, shared the front fascia with its sedan counterpart, including the tall kidney grille. The front bumper featured an air intake and side scoops for cooling. The profile revealed a long roof ending with a small spoiler, and the rear had a quad-exhaust system and diffuser similar to the sedan, with a lower bumper cut for the tailgate.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M3 Touring featured a curved display and front seats from the M3 sedan. The back had a split-folding bench for up to three passengers, expanding the trunk from 500 to 1,510 liters, though the transmission tunnel made the middle seat less comfortable.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, it had the same 503 PS (510 hp) inline-six TwinPower Turbo engine, paired with an eight-speed automatic gearbox, sending power to all four wheels.</p>

                <p>BMW refreshed the M3 lineup for the 2025 model year in the summer of 2024, with production starting in July for both Europe and North America.</p>
                <p>The M3 badge was introduced in 1986 with the E30 M3, a highly successful racing car. Initially offered only as a two-door coupe or convertible, later generations saw changes in engine and body style. The E46 introduced a straight-six engine and was available as a coupe, convertible, and sedan. Most M3s featured six-cylinder engines, except for the V8-powered M3 GTR. BMW later returned to the inline-six, adding turbocharging technology.</p>
                <p>In 2013, BMW split the 3 Series into the 4 Series (coupe, convertible, Gran Coupe) and the 3 Series (sedan, station wagon). Consequently, the M3 became available only as a four-door or station wagon. The seventh-generation M3 debuted in 2020, and a refreshed model was introduced in 2024, available as the M3 and M3 Competition.</p>
                <p>The 2025 M3 featured new LED headlights with adaptive and Matrix-LED technology, a vertical kidney grille, and a sculptured hood with power domes. The lower bumper had angular air intakes and side scoops to cool the brakes. The profile showed aggressive vents, black side sills, and flared rear wheel arches. At the rear, it had a lip spoiler, split LED taillights, and a diffuser with four exhausts.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M3 boasted high-bolstered front seats, carbon fiber options, and a curved dashboard panel with two screens for the driver and the new 8.5 BMW Operating System. The center console included controls for the automatic or six-speed manual transmission and adaptive dampers. The rear seats had space for two occupants, divided by a transmission tunnel.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the M3 retained the turbocharged straight-six engine, producing 473 hp for the manual rear-wheel drive and more power with the Competition package, which included all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>

                <p>BMW launched the M3 Competition Touring in summer 2024, combining family practicality with sports car performance. It featured a distinctive front with vertical kidney grilles and yellow LED daytime running lights. The aggressive stance included 19-inch front and 20-inch rear wheels, sculpted wheel arches, and extended side sills. At the rear, a wide roof spoiler and a broad diffuser framed a quad-exhaust system. Inside, the car offered high-bolstered bucket seats, a redesigned dashboard with a large curved glass display, and a spacious rear with a split-folding bench seat. Under the hood, the M3 Competition Touring housed the S58 turbocharged engine delivering 523 hp through an eight-speed automatic transmission to all wheels or rear wheels only.</p>

                <p>When BMW introduced the 4 Series in 2014, replacing the 3 Series coupe and convertible, fans had to adapt. The M3 coupe was replaced by the M4 in coupe and convertible forms. Despite weighing 250 kilograms (551 lbs) more than its coupe counterpart, the M4 Convertible retained a similar design and offered a retractable hard top. Up front, it featured the distinctive pinched headlights flanking the kidney grille and a wide center air intake on the bumper. Side scoops cooled the front rotors, while the profile included extracting vents on the fenders and specific side sills. At the rear, it sported a four-exhaust system and a diffuser.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M4 Convertible had high-bolstered seats for stability during cornering, though rear legroom was limited due to the retractable roof mechanism. The driver faced an analog instrument cluster with a digital display, and atop the center stack was the infotainment screen controlled via a rotary knob. Carbon fiber trims and leather upholstery were standard.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the M4 Convertible housed a turbocharged inline-six engine producing 431 PS (425 HP), sent to the rear wheels through either a six-speed manual or a seven-speed M Double Clutch gearbox, equipped with an electronically controlled limited-slip differential.</p>

                <h3>2014-2020</h3>
                <p>Back in 1985, BMW introduced the M3, a successful sports car in touring motorsport. Fast forward to the M4, it's essentially the coupe version of the M3.</p>
                <p>The M4 was basically the coupe version of the M3, with a more aggressive design compared to the 4 Series. It offered practicality with enough luggage space for two large suitcases and various cabin storage compartments, though limited due to the carbon drive shaft underneath the center.</p>
                <p>Its design featured a large open grille for better airflow, side air vents on the bumper, aerodynamic rearview mirrors, and ventilated ceramic carbon fiber brake discs. Both exterior and interior used carbon fiber to reduce weight.</p>
                <p>At the rear, it had four exhaust pipes and an integrated rear spoiler on the trunk lid for a sporty look. Despite its friendly appearance, the M4 packed a powerful punch with its 3.0-liter straight-six engine producing 425 hp, propelling the coupe from 0 to 100 kph in 4.1 seconds.</p>
                <p>With a starting price of $71,000, the M4 offered a blend of performance and luxury that justified its cost.</p>

                <h2>BMW M4 GTS</h2>
                <h3>2015-2016</h3>
                <p>BMW launched the 2015 M4 GTS in a limited run of only 700 units, with 300 of them destined for North America. The "GTS" designation wasn't just for show.</p>
                <p>BMW introduced the 2015 M4 GTS as a track-focused version of the already potent M4. It was more than just a tuned-up car; BMW's motorsport department stripped it down and rebuilt it for track performance while retaining its road legality.</p>
                <p>The M4 GTS featured extensive aerodynamic enhancements. At the front, there was an adjustable carbon fiber splitter and redesigned hood with a power dome and functional vents. Carbon fiber was used extensively for the doors, roof, trunk lid, and rear wing, which remained unpainted. The rear bumper housed a functional diffuser and four titanium exhausts, complemented by OLED taillights.</p>
                <p>Inside, the focus was on reducing weight and enhancing driver focus. Carbon fiber M bucket seats replaced the rear seats, and Alcantara and carbon fiber adorned the dashboard and center console. The thick steering wheel featured paddle shifters for the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the M4 GTS boasted a water-injection system to cool the air from its turbochargers, resulting in 493 hp and 442 lb-ft of torque—significant increases over the standard M4. It featured lightweight aluminum suspension components and a three-level adjustable suspension system.</p>
                <p>Overall, the M4 GTS shed 80 kg (176 lbs) compared to the regular M4, making it a lightweight powerhouse designed for enthusiasts seeking extreme track performance.</p>

                <h3>2017-2024</h3>
                <p>The M4 CS was produced for just two years, filling the gap between the M4 with the Competition Package and the extreme M4 GTS. It aimed to strike the perfect balance between a car designed for both track performance and daily road use.</p>
                <p>BMW aimed for a middle ground with the M4 CS, blending elements from both the M4 Competition and the extreme M4 GTS. On the exterior, it featured a fixed carbon-fiber lip spoiler at the front and a specific trunk lip at the rear, reminiscent of the GTS. It rode on 19-inch wheels at the front and 20-inch at the rear, equipped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M4 CS combined race-inspired features with comfort. It borrowed the door panels and seats from the GTS, while its suspension was derived from the M4 Competition. The infotainment system mirrored that of the standard M4.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the M4 CS housed the same turbocharged inline-six engine as the M4 Competition but with more power. It came exclusively with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox.</p>

                <h3>2020-2024</h3>
                <p>When BMW split its lineup, the sedan version of the performance-oriented 3 Series kept the M3 name, while the coupe became the 4 Series. Consequently, the high-performance coupe version was named the M4.</p>
                <p>Since BMW split the 3 Series lineup, the 4 Series took over as the coupe version, giving rise to the M4. When it debuted in June 2020, the 4 Series made a bold statement with its oversized kidney grille spanning from the apron to the hood. Side vents cooled the brakes, and the design echoed the BMW 8-Series with sculptured door panels and raked C-pillars. Four exhausts adorned the rear apron.</p>
                <p>Inside, standard sport-bucket seats complemented a TFT color display in the instrument cluster and an infotainment system on the center stack, supporting Apple CarPlay and Android phones. Automatic models featured paddle-shifters.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the M4 impressed with its all-wheel-drive system, a first for the M4 lineup, while a six-speed manual gearbox powered the rear wheels exclusively. The xDrive variant paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission.</p>

                <h2>BMW M4 Competition Convertible M xDrive</h2>
                <h3>2021-2024</h3>
                <p>In late spring 2021, BMW completed the M4 lineup by introducing its third body version: a convertible model.</p>
                <p>When BMW switched the M3 nameplate to the coupe, fans were disappointed. However, BMW stuck to its decision and introduced the M4 as both a coupe and Gran Coupe—a four-door fastback with a sloped rear liftgate.</p>
                <p>The convertible M4 maintained the coupe's aggressive front with its twin kidney grilles and LED headlights. Its soft-top roof could retract in 18 seconds at speeds up to 50 kph (31 mph). This new roof technology made it lighter than a hard-top and better insulated than a fabric one. At the rear, a new flatter trunk lid distinguished it from the coupe.</p>
                <p>Inside, the four-seat convertible boasted more standard features, including a digital TFT instrument panel replacing analog dials, a 10.1" infotainment display, and carbon fiber and aluminum trims. Sport bucket seats were also standard. Despite being a convertible, it offered a practical 300 liters (10.6 cu-ft) trunk with the roof down and 385 liters (13.6 cu-ft) with the top up.</p>
                <p>The drivetrain mirrored the coupe's, featuring all-wheel-drive permanently engaged without the option to disengage the front wheels.</p>

                <h3>2022-Present</h3>
                <p>BMW has a history of making lightweight cars based on its performance models, and the 2022 M4 CSL (Competition Sport Lightweight) continued this tradition.</p>
                <p>In 2023, BMW launched the M4 CSL to honor the legendary E9 CSL from 1973, famed for its racing prowess in the European Touring Car Championship. This limited edition model, with only 1000 units produced, focused intensely on performance, fine-tuned on the Nurburgring race track.</p>
                <p>To achieve a significant weight reduction of 240 lbs (110 kg) compared to the M4 Competition, BMW utilized extensive carbon-fiber components. These included a carbon-fiber hood with black vents, CFRP (carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic) for the roof and trunk lid, and bumper elements made from the same material. Notably, the CSL also featured a distinctive ducktail spoiler at the rear.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M4 CSL was equipped with manual carbon-fiber sport seats that were 53 lbs (24 kg) lighter than standard. Rear seats and seatbelts were removed to further reduce weight, although basic amenities such as an infotainment system with speakers were retained for driver convenience.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW enhanced the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine, delivering power to the rear wheels through an eight-speed M Steptronic transmission.</p>

                <h2>BMW M4 CS</h2>
                <h3>2024-Present</h3>
                <p>In early 2024, BMW updated the second generation of the 4 Series Coupe with a Life Cycle Update. Just a few months later, they introduced the M4 CS version.</p>
                <p>When BMW split the 3 Series Sedan from its Coupe version to introduce the 4 Series, some enthusiasts were initially upset. However, they soon realized the 4 Series wasn't just a rebranded 3 Series with fewer doors; it was thoroughly re-engineered and significantly enhanced. The M4, in particular, quickly became iconic for its aggressive styling, powerful engine, and blistering performance that even gave supercars a run for their money. BMW expanded the M4 lineup to include the Competition, CSL, and CS variants.</p>
                <p>In May 2024, BMW refreshed the M4 CS with significant upgrades and tested its capabilities on the Nürburgring's Nordschleife circuit, where it clocked an impressive lap time of 7 minutes, 21.989 seconds for the full 20.832-kilometer (12.943-mile) lap. This time surpassed benchmarks like the Corvette C06 Z07 and a 690-horsepower Lamborghini Aventador 700-4.</p>
                <p>BMW referred to these updates as "Life Cycle Impulse" rather than a traditional facelift. The 2024 M4 CS featured a redesigned front fascia with slimmer LED headlights, distinctive yellow daytime running lights, and the signature vertical kidney grille. The lower bumper included angular air intakes and a carbon fiber lip spoiler. The profile showcased new forged alloy wheels, functional exhaust vents, and sculpted carbon fiber side sills. Inside, the focus was on lightweight construction, with Merino leather sports seats, carbon fiber trims, and the latest iDrive 8.5 infotainment system.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW enhanced the M4 CS with a more potent S58 twin-turbocharged inline-six engine, delivering 542 horsepower and utilizing an eight-speed automatic transmission to distribute power to all four wheels. The result was a lighter, more agile, and extremely capable sports coupe that continued to push the boundaries of performance and luxury.</p>

                <p>In 2024, BMW refreshed the second-generation M4 with more power and a fiercer front design aimed to intimidate its rivals.</p>
                <p>After BMW split the 3 Series into the 3 and 4 Series, the iconic M3 coupe was no more, replaced by the M4 and its variants like the M4 Competition and M4 CSL. In 2020, BMW launched the second-generation M4, which received a refresh in 2024 along with other 4 Series models. Unlike its siblings, the 2024 M4 received 20 extra horsepower and a distinct front design featuring the controversial kidney grille with horizontal slats. Its headlights were upgraded to standard LEDs, with optional Adaptive LED lamps. The front bumper had angular shapes with a broad central intake and slim side scoops.</p>
                <p>From the side, the M4 showcased vents on the front fenders and came with forged wheels in 18-inch front and 19-inch rear sizes, upgradeable to 19-inch front and 20-inch rear options. All models featured a carbon fiber roof for lower center of gravity. At the rear, it offered standard LED taillights with an optional 3-D effect using laser diodes and glass fibers. Inside, the M4 boasted a flat-bottom steering wheel wrapped in leather or Alcantara, sports seats with integrated headrests, and optional carbon-fiber seats. A new curved display housed the iDrive 8.5 OS for the infotainment system.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the M4 LCI retained the S85 three-liter inline-six engine with twin turbos, delivering 480 PS (473 hp), 510 PS (503 hp), or 530 PS (523 hp) depending on the variant. Transmission options included a six-speed manual for rear-wheel drive, an eight-speed automatic for rear-wheel drive, and an eight-speed automatic with all-wheel drive (xDrive).</p>

                <h3>2024-Present</h3>
                <p>While not the fastest in the M4 lineup, the convertible versions appealed to drivers seeking fast cars that offered the thrill of open-air driving.</p>
                <p>After BMW launched the first generation of the M4 in 2014, they quickly followed with an open-top version known as the M4 Convertible. Then, in 2020, they introduced the second generation of the 4 Series, which included the M4 G82 for the 2021 model year. Just 27 months later, in early 2024, BMW unveiled a facelifted version of the M4, available in both coupe and convertible models.</p>
                <p>The 2024 M4 Convertible retained the controversial tall kidney grille but updated its standard LED headlights with a new design, optional laser lights, and maintained its sleek, swept-back shape. It featured wheels ranging from 18 inches at the front to 19 inches at the rear, with larger options available. Behind the rear wheels, there were exhaust vents adding to its sporty appearance. The retractable hard top could be operated in 18 seconds at speeds up to 50 kph (31 mph), offering open-air driving at the touch of a button. LED taillights came standard, with optional laser diode lights and 3-D effect fiberglass inserts.</p>
                <p>Inside, the 2024 M4 Convertible showcased a new curved dashboard design with dual screens: one for the driver and a touchscreen atop the center stack, all under a single piece of glass. Powered by BMW’s iDrive 8.5 OS, it featured a leather-wrapped steering wheel with paddle shifters for automatic models, with an Alcantara option available. Front sports seats and a two-person bench in the rear provided seating, though legroom was limited for adults on longer trips.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, BMW retained the S58 bi-turbo inline-six engine from the previous model, offering power outputs of 480 PS (473 hp), 510 PS (503 hp), and 530 PS (523 hp) depending on the transmission and drivetrain configuration.</p>

                <h3>1985-1988</h3>
                <p>The 1985 E28 was the first BMW 5 Series to wear the M5 badge, blending sports car performance with luxurious sedan comfort.</p>
                <p>The BMW M5 debuted in late 1985 as a successor to the M535i, arriving almost four years after its predecessor. Unlike its predecessor, the M5 offered more than just increased power; it featured unique exterior styling and a luxurious interior.</p>
                <p>At the front, it retained the E28's four-headlight design but sported a black grille with an M5 badge and BMW Motorsport stripes. The lower bumper included rectangular fog lamps and turn signals, complemented by an added apron for a sportier appearance.</p>
                <p>Its profile hinted at performance with a forward-leaning stance, BBS multi-spoke alloy wheels, and black window trims, departing from the chrome-heavy styling of its era. At the rear, options included a flat spoiler and center-mounted dual exhausts reminiscent of the M535i.</p>
                <p>Inside, the M5 boasted a sporty cabin with cloth or leather upholstery. The front seats featured high bolsters and BMW Motorsport's signature colors embroidered on the seatbacks. The driver faced a specialized instrument cluster with a prominent tachometer and onboard computer panel. The center console housed the gear stick and power window controls, with a rear bench seat for two passengers.</p>
                <p>Under the hood, the M5 housed the M88/3 inline-six engine, delivering 282 horsepower from its 3.5-liter displacement. Power flowed to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential. Enhanced by BMW Motorsport with a stiffer suspension and gas-filled struts, the E28 M5 set a new benchmark, sparking a horsepower rivalry among German automakers.</p>

                <h3>1988-1995</h3>
                <p>In 1988, BMW unveiled the third generation of the 5 Series and promptly launched its high-performance variant, the M5, in the same year.</p>
                <p>BMW anticipated the M5's success after the E28, which had 286 PS (282 hp), so the next model had to be even more potent. The E34 M5, launched in 1988, featured a slightly larger engine with significantly increased power. BMW Motorsport also upgraded the suspension, brakes, and transmission. While BMW aimed for a refined exterior—not as bold as the flamboyant M3—the E34 M5 still had subtle enhancements.</p>
                <p>Distinctive features included standard lenses for the low-beam headlights and a modified lower bumper with dual-nozzle washers and squared fog lamps. The profile showcased unique side sills and special three-piece alloy wheels designed to cool the brakes. Inside, the cabin exuded luxury with leather upholstery and M badges, while an LED display provided onboard computer data. Hand-assembled, the E34 M5 boasted exceptional fit and finish.</p>
                <p>Initially powered by a 3.5-liter naturally aspirated engine producing 315 PS (311 hp), it was the sole version available in the U.S., with 8,344 units produced. In 1991, BMW introduced the S38B38 3.8-liter engine, delivering 340 PS (335 hp), paired with a five-speed manual until 1994, when a six-speed gearbox was introduced. All models featured a limited-slip differential for enhanced performance.</p>

                <h3>1992-1996</h3>
                <p>In 1992, BMW surprised everyone by introducing the M5 Touring, a high-performance station wagon that challenged its competitors to match its speed and utility.</p>
                <p>The German automaker introduced the 5 Series (the E12) on the market in 1972 as a sedan and kept it that way up until the third generation, which it released in 1988. But then, in 1992, BMW refreshed the lineup, and besides the sedan, it also introduced the station wagon, which was named Touring, according to the carmaker’s naming system. If that was not enough, then the addition of a hand-built M5 Touring was even more surprising. But customers were not prepared for such a vehicle. As a result, the automaker managed to sell less than 1,000 units of it. The good side of the story was that all of them came with the enhanced S38B38 inline-six engine, which was more potent than its predecessor.</p>

                <h2>BMW M5 (E39)</h2>
                <h3>1998-2004</h3>
                <p>Three years after the introduction of the E39 5 Series, BMW launched the most potent version of it, the M5, which was the first of its kind to ditch the inline-six powerplant.</p>
                <p>The third generation of vehicles wearing the M5 badge was the first to be mass-produced on an assembly line instead of hand-crafted by the wizards from BMW Motorsport. The automaker introduced it at the Geneva Motor Show in 1998 and refreshed it for the 2000 model year. It was the kind of vehicle that could set your hair on fire and extinguish it in a controlled drift around a corner. And it did all that while it was still a comfortable, elegant, and slightly luxurious four-door sedan. Moreover, it was the last analog M5, fitted with a six-speed manual and a mechanical limited-slip differential. Even though the M5s that followed were faster than it, some considered the E39 M5 as the best of them all. And it was not just about the engine. It was the entire package that helped it achieve that status.</p>

                <h3>2005-2010</h3>
                <p>BMW decided to take its gloves off from the M5, and while the previous generations of this moniker were somehow subtle, the 2004 E60 version was not subtle at all; it was flamboyant.</p>
                <p>In 2004, BMW launched the fifth generation of the M5, or the fourth if you don’t take the M535i into account since it didn’t sport that specific badge. The difference between the most powerful version of the E60 5 Series and the rest of its siblings was massive. It wasn’t just about a specific engine and a stiffer suspension. It was about everything: from the car’s look to the interior and the technical underpinnings, it was a completely different vehicle. Furthermore, it didn’t have the exact same look.</p>

                <p>BMW refreshed the fifth generation of the 5 Series in 2007 and, along with it, unveiled the M-powered version of the 5 Series Touring.</p>
                <p>The introduction of an M-powered version for the 5 Series station wagon was no longer something unexpected since the previous M5 (the E34) was also available with a long-roof shape. But creating one offered exclusively with the SMG single-clutch automated gearbox was. However, BMW had to do something to improve the sales of the fifth generation of the 5 Series, which were not particularly high. Furthermore, the station wagon didn’t do well on the market compared with the carmaker’s main rivals, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. As a result, the 2007 M5 Touring broke covers and stirred emotions. While it wasn’t sold in high numbers, it became one of the fastest family vehicles on the market.</p>

                <p>BMW introduced the sixth generation of the 5 Series in 2010, and in the following year, it came with the M5 version, which opened a new chapter in the moniker's history.</p>
                <p>While all the previous M5s, or the M535i, were powered by naturally aspirated engines that sent their power to the rear wheels, the 2011 M5 was not. Moreover, the 2011 M5 was not subtle nor quiet from the outside, but it wasn't too flamboyant as its predecessor, the V10-powered E60 M5. To make it, BMW tossed away the guidebooks of this nameplate's previous generations and started from scratch. In addition, the car was beautifully designed by Jacek Fröhlich in 2006, under the supervision of the same Chris Bangle, who made the brand's fans angry. But nevertheless, the American designer's ideas were correct, and only time proved that.</p>

                <p>Even though the M5 was just two years old, it still needed to join the pack and get the necessary upgrades. As a result, the car received a few exterior and interior upgrades, along with more power under the hood. In addition, the automaker provided customers with the option of a Competition Package, which raised the power even more. But the automaker didn't stop there. It also included new color options and new features that made long journeys more pleasant and fast laps around a track safer.</p>

                <p>The sixth generation of the M5 came on the market in 2017 and instantly became a benchmark for the sports sedan segment thanks to its powerful engines and rich features.</p>
                <p>Ever since the first generation of the M5 in 1984, the German automaker started the power-horse war in the mid-size sedan segment of the European market. While in the U.S., it was not something unusual to see such vehicles fitted with large engines, in Europe, it was. The evolution continued with larger naturally-aspirated powerplants until the fourth generation of the M5, the E60, which featured a mighty 5.0-liter V10 under the hood. Afterward, BMW lowered the engines’ displacements for this nameplate but added turbochargers. As a result, the fifth reiteration of this model (the F10 M5) and its successor, the F90 M5, came with a 4.4-liter V8, helped by a pair of turbos.</p>

                <p>After introducing the seventh generation of the 5 Series and its M-version, the German automaker dared even more and launched the M5 Competition in 2018.</p>
                <p>Unlike its previous generations, which kept the same chassis coding as their non-M brothers, the sixth generation of the M5 (or the fifth, if you don’t count the 1979 M535i E28) wore the F90 designation name instead of the G30 like the rest of the sixth generation of the 5 Series. But that was not the only difference. The M5 that BMW launched in 2017 had the same 4.4-liter twin-turbo engine as its predecessor, just upgraded. And then, in 2018, the German automaker raised the horsepower bar once again with the 2018 M5 Competition. BMW considered launching this version as soon as possible, with proper upgrades, since the previous F10 M5 Competition Package enjoyed high success among customers.</p>

Both vehicles were highly appreciated by the media worldwide and by the brand’s fans. Even though these two models came with turbocharged engines and all-wheel drive systems, they were quickly accepted by the brand’s fans, especially since the car could be easily converted into a rear-wheel drive vehicle at a flick of a switch. Therefore, when the 2020 model year came on the market, the M5 Competition already had its established fan base. And it just got better.</p>

                <p>Almost forty years have passed since BMW introduced the first generation of the 5 Series in 1972, and the German automaker has improved this lineup constantly. However, the M5 F90 was the first to get not one but two upgrades over its short production run. So, while the M5 was for those who wanted a luxurious, go-fast car and the M5 Competition was for those craving a go-fast elegant vehicle, the 2021 M5 CS was for those who really wanted a four-door, four-seat vehicle that could breach into the supercar territory thanks to its performance. But the M5 CS was not just about power. It provided just ten ponies more than the M5 Competition. It was about look, suspension, weight reduction, and exclusivity.</p>

                <h2>BMW M8 Convertible</h2>
                <h3>2022-Present</h3>
                <p>Since the open-top vehicles are usually slower than their coupe siblings, most car enthusiasts prefer the latter for performance. Yet, the convertibles are somehow more attractive, and thus, there is a serious market for them, especially if they are fitted with high-power engines.</p>
                <p>The M8 Competition Convertible received a facelifted version at the beginning of 2022, along with its hard-roof versions, the Coupe, and the Gran Coupe. Yes, it couldn't match them in terms of acceleration times or hard-cornering abilities, but it had more flavor with the top down while cruising on the streets.</p>

                <h2>BMW M8 Coupe</h2>
                <h3>2022-Present</h3>
                <p>BMW introduced a facelifted version for the 8th Series' second generation in 2022, and it offered it with the M-treatment for every body shape. But the brand's purists couldn't choose anything else than the coupe version.</p>
                <p>When the first generation of the 8-Series, the E31, was unveiled, BMW's fans asked for an M-version. The carmaker worked on that, made the prototype, and then hid it into storage, where it remained forever. But with the second generation of the 8-Series, which happened in 2018, the carmaker didn't avoid the high-performance version for it and made the M8 Competition. Moreover, it offered it on all three body styles: Coupe, Convertible, and Gran Coupe.</p>
